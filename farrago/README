RELEASE NOTES

This source release is intended for use by developers who want
to explore the Farrago codebase.  Farrago relies on a large number of
third-party dependencies, so developers who want to build it should
download a full Eigenbase source release.

Developers should be aware that all internal interfaces (API's,
SPI's, and class libraries) are still in a fluid state and subject to
frequent review and change.  As interfaces solidify, they will be
officially frozen in future releases.
