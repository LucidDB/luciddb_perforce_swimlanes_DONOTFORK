/**
 * An object is <code>Iterable</code> if it has an {@link #iterator} method to
 * create an {@link Iterator} over its elements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some implementations of this interface may allow only one iterator at a
 * time. For example, {@link BufferedIterator} simply restarts and returns
 * itself. Iterators received from previous calls to {@link #iterator} will
 * also restart.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an object implements this interface, it can be used as a relation in a
 * saffron relational expression. For example,
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>Iterable iterable = new Iterable() {
 *     public Iterator iterator() {
 *         ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
 *         list.add(new Integer(1));
 *         list.add(new Integer(2));
 *         return list.iterator();
 *     }
 * };
 * for (i in (Integer[]) iterable) {
 *     print(i.intValue());
 * }</pre>
 * </blockquote>
