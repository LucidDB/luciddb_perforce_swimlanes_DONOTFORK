<p>The standard set of row-level functions and operators are declared in class
{@link org.eigenbase.sql.fun.SqlStdOperatorTable}.  Anonymous inner classes
within that table are allowed only for specifying an operator's test
function; if other custom code is needed for an operator, it should
be implemented in a top-level class within this package instead.
Operators which are not row-level (e.g. select and join) should be defined
in package {@link org.eigenbase.sql} instead.
