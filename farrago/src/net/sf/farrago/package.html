The UML diagram below illustrates the dependencies among Farrago subpackages:

<p>

Transitive depenencies are mostly left out (so if package A depends on
package B, and package B depends on C, it's implied that package A may
depend on package C as well).  In this context, dependency means early
binding; that is, the higher-level package references the lower-level
package at compile time.  Packages with italicized names are interface
packages.

<p>

Note that the farrago.trace package is special in that it is allowed
(and in fact required) to participate in circular dependencies with other
packages.

<p>
TBD: dependencies on packages like java.sql, org.eigenbase, and MDR.
Also need to show com.disruptivetech.**, com.lucidera.**.  And:

<ul>
<li>farrago.jdbc depends on farrago.release
<li>farrago.jdbc.client depends on farrago.fennel.tuple
<li>farrago.util depends on farrago.release
</ul>

<p>

Dependencies are checked via the <a
href="http://innig.net/macker">macker</a> tool.  Currently, this is
done manually, but will eventually there will be an automated checkin
monkey for enforcement, so that when macker gets mad, he'll send you
email and give you a piece of his mind.  Dependency definitions are in
<a href="http://p4web.eigenbase.org/open/dev/farrago/src/macker.xml">
//open/dev/farrago/src/macker.xml</a>.

<p>

Note that late binding is allowed to violate the layering.  For
example, the util layer defines the {@link
net.sf.farrago.util.FarragoAllocation} interface.  The db layer
defines class {@link net.sf.farrago.db.FarragoDbStmtContext}, which
implements FarragoAllocation, and passes an instance to {@link
net.sf.farrago.util.FarragoCompoundAllocation}.  When the
FarragoCompoundAllocation is closed, it calls back via the interface,
meaning at runtime, code in the util layer ends up calling code in the
db layer.
