Top-level package containing all Farrago subpackages.

The UML diagram below illustrates the dependencies among Farrago subpackages:

<p>

Transitive depenencies are mostly left out (so if package A depends on
package B, and package B depends on C, it's implied that package A may
depend on package C as well).  In this context, dependency means early
binding; that is, the higher-level package references the lower-level
package at compile time.  Packages with italicized names are interface
packages.

<p>

The cwm and fem packages are special because they contain generated
repository interfaces, but also contain implementation classes.  The
dependencies for the two kinds of code are very different, and so
are shown separately (the farrago.cwm and farrago.fem packages in the
lower right represent the generated code; the farrago.cwm.impl and
farrago.fem.impl packages in the upper left represent the
implementation classes).

<p>

TBD: dependencies on packages like java.sql, org.eigenbase, and MDR.  TODO:
update diagram to show that farrago.runtime depends on
farrago.session, and add farrago.plugin, farrago.ojrex.  Also note
special case for farrago.trace.  farrago.type.runtime depends on
farrago.resource.  Also com.disruptivetech.**.

<p>

Dependencies are checked via the <a
href="http://innig.net/macker">macker</a> tool.  Currently, this is
done manually, but will eventually there will be an automated checkin
monkey for enforcement, so that when macker gets mad, he'll send you
email and give you a piece of his mind.  Dependency definitions are in
<a href="http://p4web.eigenbase.org/open/dev/farrago/src/macker.xml">
//open/dev/farrago/src/macker.xml</a>.

<p>

Note that late binding is allowed to violate the layering.  For
example, the util layer defines the {@link
net.sf.farrago.util.FarragoAllocation} interface.  The db layer
defines class {@link net.sf.farrago.db.FarragoDbStmtContext}, which
implements FarragoAllocation, and passes an instance to {@link
net.sf.farrago.util.FarragoCompoundAllocation}.  When the
FarragoCompoundAllocation is closed, it calls back via the interface,
meaning at runtime, code in the util layer ends up calling code in the
db layer.
