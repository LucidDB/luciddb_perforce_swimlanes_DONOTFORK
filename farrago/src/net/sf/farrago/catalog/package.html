Implements the Farrago metadata catalog.

<hr>

The Farrago catalog is implemented as an instance of the <a
href="http://mdr.netbeans.org">Netbeans MDR</a> repository.  {@link
net.sf.farrago.catalog.FarragoRepos} takes care of starting up and
shutting down the repository, as well as exposing root packages and
providing utilities for querying and updating the catalog.

<h3>Catalog Build</h3>

The diagram below provides an overview of the build-time processing
which orchestrates catalog definition and access:

There are two inputs to the process:

<ul>

<li>The standard <a href="http://www.omg.org/cwm">CWM</a> data
warehouse metamodel.  The XMI definition for this metamodel is
provided by OMG.

<li>Farrago-specific extensions, referred to as FEM (the Farrago
Extension Metamodel).  The UML definition for this metamodel is
maintained by the Farrago developers (using the community edition of
the Poseidon UML modeling tool from <a
href="http://www.gentleware.com">Gentleware</a>.

</ul>

<p>

The first step of the catalog build is to combine the two models into
a single XMI file before further processing.  This requires a bit of
XMI massaging; custom XSL scripts make this reasonably painless.
(Since MDR uses MOF, we use the <a
href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/uml2mof">UML2MOF tool</a> to convert
FEM.)  Some filtering is also performed; for example, Farrago only
uses the following CWM packages:

<ul>
<li>org.omg::CWM::ObjectModel::Behavioral
<li>org.omg::CWM::ObjectModel::Core
<li>org.omg::CWM::ObjectModel::Instance
<li>org.omg::CWM::Foundation::DataTypes
<li>org.omg::CWM::Foundation::KeysIndexes
</ul>

<p>
Next, the combined metamodel is imported into a new MDR repository
instance and stored in an extent named FarragoMetamodel.  A singleton
instance of this metamodel is instantiated with extent name
FarragoCatalog; this will store actual catalog data.

<p>

Besides storage, model-specific Java interfaces are also required for
accessing the catalog at runtime.  For example, a table is represented
by {@link net.sf.farrago.cwm.relational.CwmTable}.  The build calls
MDR to generate these from the metamodel.  The CWM interfaces are
generated under package {@link net.sf.farrago.cwm}, and the FEM
interfaces are generated under package {@link net.sf.farrago.fem}.
Custom code-generators in {@link net.sf.farrago.catalog.codegen } take
care of generating convenience class {@link
net.sf.farrago.FarragoMetadataFactory } and C++ code used for JNI
access to the model (TODO: link).

<p>

As shown at the bottom of the diagram, a DTD is also generated which
describes the XMI format of catalog import/export data (all of which is
implemented by MDR).

<p>

For more details on the build process, please study the createCatalog
target in <code>//open/dev/farrago/build.xml</code>.

<h3>Catalog Population</h3>

In addition to preparing an empty catalog, the build also populates it
with some initial metadata.  Currently, this includes:

<ul>

<li>supported datatypes

<li>builtin data wrappers needed by system

<li>internal schema defining JDBC metadata views

<li>sample schemas and data wrappers

<li>initial configuration information</li>

</ul>

Eventually, this will include many other things such as the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA definition, lists of supported functions,
system-owned schemas and procedures, etc.  (The sample SALES schema is
only for developer testing and will not be present in released
distributions.)

<p>

Once the system is fully initialized, DDL statements executed by users
can also modify the catalog.  The geneneric DDL implementation is in
{@link net.sf.farrago.ddl}.  Specific validation and storage rules for
various catalog objects are supplied by {@link net.sf.farrago.ddl.DdlHandler}.
