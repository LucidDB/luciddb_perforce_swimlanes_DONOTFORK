<body>

Contains services.

<p>A service is a method call that can be accessed from any JDBC
client. Generally a service is implemented by calling a UDX
(user-defined transform) on the server, and often that UDX is in the
{@code net.sf.farrago.syslib} package.

<p>All classes in this package have very lightweight
dependencies. Usually they just depend on JDBC. Sometimes they contain
definitions that are used on the server; but they must not depend on
server classes.
