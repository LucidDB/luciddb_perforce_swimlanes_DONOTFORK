<h1>Farrago Low-Hanging Fruit</h1>

This is a list of small projects which do not require any deep
knowledge of Farrago internals; they should be accessible to anyone
familiar with Java.  In some cases, it may be possible to implement
them using just a binary release of Farrago; but if you run into
trouble, a source release may be required for debugging and tweaking
peripheral code (e.g. in the JDBC driver).

<ul>

<li>Get Farrago to run in a web app container such as Tomcat.  Use the
Farrago engine JDBC driver directly (instead of the RMI driver);
provide a web page which performs administrative functions such as
starting and stopping the engine, and other web pages which access
data via direct JDBC calls.  Optionally, allow control over starting
and stopping the RMI server as well.

<li>Make it possible for Farrago to query XML data via SQL/MED.
ObjectWeb provides a simple XML JDBC driver as part of their Octopus
ETL project.  See <a href="design/medjdbc.html">the Farrago SQL/MED
Plugin for JDBC</a> and <a href="http://octopus.objectweb.org">the
Octopus project</a>.

<li>Set up a benchmark or standard test suite for Farrago.  We don't
expect good performance right now, but benchmarks usually make good
system-level tests.  Some possibilities include <a

and <a href="http://osdb.sf.net">osdb</a>.
