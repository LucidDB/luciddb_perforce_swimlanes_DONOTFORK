<h1>What's Working Already?</h1>

Here's a laundry list of SQL features which are already working in
Farrago as of release 0.9.  If a sub-feature isn't
mentioned (e.g. CHECK clause in CREATE TABLE), it isn't available yet.
Everything is supposed to work according to the SQL standard, so if
something doesn't, that's either a bug or an incomplete feature.
Which standard?  Normal procedure is to consult the SQL:2003 standard
and cross-check it with SQL-92 and SQL:1999 to see if there are any
incompatibilities.

<h2>DDL</h2>

<ul>

<li>All identifiers may be up to 128 characters.  Identifiers may be
quoted (with case-sensitivity) or unquoted (with implicit uppercasing
before both storage and lookup).  The compound identifier
"catalog_name"."schema_name"."object_name" fully qualifies a schema
element.

<li>SET CATALOG: the system currently starts out with several catalogs
predefined (SYS_BOOT, SYS_MOF, SYS_CWM, SYS_FEM, and LOCALDB).
Additional catalogs can be created implicitly via the SQL/MED CREATE
SERVER command.  The SYS_BOOT catalog contains internal tables for
metadata storage, along with things like views for implementing JDBC
metadata.  The SYS_MOF catalog is a virtual catalog exposing the
highest-level metamodel.  The SYS_CWM catalog is a virtual catalog
exposing the contents of the CWM-based repository.  SYS_FEM is
similar, but for Farrago extensions to CWM.  The LOCALDB catalog
stores user metadata about both local and foreign tables.  The default
catalog starts out as LOCALDB; SET CATALOG can be used to change this
per-session.

<li>SET SCHEMA: user schemas are created in the LOCALDB catalog.
SET SCHEMA can be used to change the default schema within the
current catalog.  The SYS_CWM catalog defines one schema per CWM package
(e.g. "Core", "Relational", or "KeysIndexes"); the tables in the CWM
schemas correspond to classes (e.g. schema SYS_CWM."Core" contains
"ModelElement" and "Feature"; schema SYS_CWM."Relational" contains "Table"
and "View").  Likewise for SYS_FEM.

<li>CREATE SCHEMA: a schema can be created by itself, or together with
all of its contents in the same statement.  The AUTHORIZATION clause
is currently parsed but ignored.  The PATH clause is supported
for UDR/UDT lookup.

<li>CREATE TABLE: for the default row-store implementation, every
table must have a primary key.  Supported column datatypes are
BOOLEAN, TINYINT, SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT, DECIMAL (alias NUMERIC),
REAL, DOUBLE (alias DOUBLE PRECISION), VARCHAR (alias CHARACTER
VARYING), VARBINARY, CHAR (alias CHARACTER), BINARY, DATE, TIME,
TIMESTAMP, and user-defined type.  Decimal precision is limited to 19
digits.  Time precision is currently limited to seconds, but will
eventually be enhanced to microseconds (which should be the default
for TIMESTAMP according to the SQL standard).  Timezones are not yet
supported.  Support for standard <a
href="design/CollectionTypes.html">multisets</a> and time intervals is
currently under development.  <a
href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/AutoincrementColumns">Autoincrement
columns</a> are supported.

<li>NOT NULL: can be specified explicitly on any column; is also
implied for columns which participate in the table's primary key (or
clustered index for row-store tables).

<li>DEFAULT: can be specified for any column; otherwise default value
is NULL.  Currently, default values can only be literals of the appropriate
datatype (not arbitrary expressions).

<li>PRIMARY KEY/UNIQUE:  constraints can be specified at either the
column level or the table level.  Constraints can be named, and are
enforced via implicitly created indexes.

<li>CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX: if specified, this must be at the
end of the CREATE TABLE statement, not in a separate statement.  Example:  
<pre><code>
create table t(i int not null primary key,j int not null,k int)
create clustered index t_x on t(j);
create index t_y on t(k);
<code></pre>
If not specified, the primary key is used implicitly for clustering.
<a href="design/TableIndexing.html">
For the default row-store, every table has exactly one clustered index</a>.

<li>CREATE INDEX: unclustered indexes can be created either
at the end of the table definition or in separate statements.  Indexes
are considered to be schema elements but are always created in the same
schema as their containing table.

<li>CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE: supports ON COMMIT
{PRESERVE|DELETE} [ROWS] option.  Note that the "GLOBAL TEMPORARY"
name in the standard is confusing: this is really an
instantiate-on-reference session-local temporary table with a
permanent shared metadata definition in the catalog.  Any indexes on a
temporary table must be specified together with the CREATE TABLE
statement; indexes may not be subsequently added or dropped (if you
need that, drop and recreate the table definition).  Beyond that,
temporary tables support the same features as permanent tables
(constraints, defaults, etc.).  However, see the "What's Broken" section
below for some known issues.

<li>CREATE VIEW:  all views are currently read-only.

<li><a href="design/sqlmed.html">SQL/MED</a> support.  CREATE/DROP
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER, CREATE/DROP SERVER, and CREATE/DROP FOREIGN
TABLE are working, along with IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA.  Implementations
for JDBC, flatfiles and MDR are available (the MDR implementation is already
being used for exposing the catalog contents via SQL).  The system
starts out with foreign data wrappers SYS_MDR, SYS_MOCK_FOREIGN,
SYS_JDBC, and SYS_FILE_WRAPPER predefined.  Foreign data server
SYS_MOCK_FOREIGN_DATA_SERVER and HSQLDB_DEMO can be used for test purposes.

<li><a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31121738&forum_id=33354">Pluggable
storage engine support</a> via CREATE/DROP LOCAL DATA WRAPPER.  The
system starts out with local data wrappers SYS_FTRS (row-store) and
SYS_COLUMN_STORE (<a href="http://www.luciddb.org">LucidDB
column-store)</a>, as well as SYS_MOCK.  A corresponding local data server
(SYS_FTRS_DATA_SERVER, SYS_COLUMN_STORE_DATA_SERVER, or
SYS_MOCK_DATA_SERVER) can be specified in the SERVER clause for CREATE
TABLE when creating a local table (default is SYS_FTRS_DATA_SERVER for
vanilla Farrago session personality).

<li><a href="design/UserDefinedTypesAndRoutines.html#Routines">CREATE
FUNCTION/PROCEDURE</a>: supports functions with SQL-defined bodies
consisting of a single RETURN statement, and Java-defined external
functions and procedures with IN parameters only.  For external
functions, parameters must be of builtin type.  Procedure result sets
are not supported, but see <a
href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/FarragoUdx">the UDX spec</a> for user-defined
transformation functions which take cursors as input and return
tables as output.  External routines may call back into JDBC via
standard <code>jdbc:default:connection</code>.
</li>

<li><a href="design/UserDefinedTypesAndRoutines.html#Types">CREATE
TYPE/CONSTRUCTOR/ORDERING</a>: supports SQL-defined types (both
structured and distinct, but not domains and not SQL/JRT).  Neither
type inheritance nor typed tables are supported.  Constructor methods
may only consist of a list of SET attribute statements followed by
RETURN SELF.  Observers are supported but mutators are not.
User-defined casts and transformations are not supported, but
user-defined orderings are.  Directly querying distinct type values via
JDBC is supported; this is currently unreliable for structured types.
</li>

<li>CALL SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR/REMOVE_JAR: standard system-defined
procedures for jar management.  Also supported are non-standard
CREATE/DROP JAR statements; these are equivalent and used internally
to implement the standard SQLJ procedures.  Deployment descriptors and
jar paths are not yet supported.

<li>SET PATH: defines the lookup scope for user-defined routine and
type references.</li>

<li>DROP: both RESTRICT and CASCADE are supported where relevant.

<li>DROP INDEX:  only unclustered indexes may be dropped.

<li>TRUNCATE TABLE "tbl":  delete all rows from tbl without logging them
individually.

<li><a href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/FarragoTableRebuild">ALTER
TABLE "tbl" REBUILD</a>: physically reorganize table contents, purging
deleted entries and rebalancing indexes where supported.

<li><a href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/FarragoAlterTableAddColumn">ALTER
TABLE "tbl" ADD COLUMN</a>: add a new column to an existing table.

<li><a href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/TableStatistics">ANALYZE TABLE
"tbl" {ESTIMATE|COMPUTE} STATISTICS FOR { ALL COLUMNS | COLUMNS (a, b, c...)
}</a>: collect statistics on stored data distribution for use by the
optimizer.

<li>ALTER SYSTEM SET "parameterName" = value; change a system
parameter (see <a
href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/FarragoSystemParameters">documentation
for all parameters</a>).

<li>CHECKPOINT:  force an immediate checkpoint.

<li>COMMIT:  commit current transaction.

<li>ROLLBACK:  rollback current transaction.

<li>SAVEPOINT "x":  create a savepoint with name x.

<li>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT "x": partially rollback current transaction
to savepoint x.

<h2>Queries</h2>

<ul>

<li>SELECT [DISTINCT] ... FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ... HAVING ... ORDER BY

<li>UNION [ALL], INTERSECT, EXCEPT

<li>FROM clause may contain tables, views, multi-row VALUES,
LEFT/RIGHT/INNER/CROSS JOIN, old-style comma list, nested queries,
UDX invocations, and explicit TABLE references.

<li><a href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/FarragoExplainPlanExplained">
EXPLAIN PLAN [ { EXCLUDING | INCLUDING [ ALL ] } ATTRIBUTES ]
[{WITH|WITHOUT} IMPLEMENTATION] [AS XML] FOR
<em>query-or-DML-statement</em></a>; shows optimizer plan.  WITHOUT
IMPLEMENTATION yields unoptimized abstract relational plan.  Default
is WITH IMPLEMENTATION, which yields optimized plan with all physical
operators.  AS XML yields detailed output in element-oriented XML.
EXCLUDING ATTRIBUTES shows relational operator names only.  
INCLUDING ATTRIBUTES is the default.  INCLUDING ALL ATTRIBUTES provides
additional attributes such as cost.

<li><a href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/TableStatistics#Sampling">TABLESAMPLE</a>
with BERNOULLI and SYSTEM options

<li>The LucidDB SQL reference has the most up-to-date list of
<a href="http://docs.eigenbase.org/LucidDbValueExpression">supported row
expressions</a>

</ul>

<h2>DML</h2>

<ul>

<li>INSERT

<li>UPDATE

<li>DELETE

<li>MERGE (FTRS support not yet available)

<li>CALL

</ul>

<h2>JDBC API</h2>

<ul>

<li>prepared statements with dynamic parameters 
(e.g. <code>select * from emps where name=?</code>)

<li>DatabaseMetaData:  all except getTablePrivileges, getColumnPrivileges,
getBestRowIdentifier, getVersionColumns, getImportedKeys, getExportedKeys,
getCrossReference

<li>savepoint API

<li>autocommit or manual commit (either via API or via SQL)

<li>implicit query plan cache

</ul>

<h2>Optimizer</h2>

<ul>

<li>hash join/agg and nested loop joins for inner and outer joins

<li>cartesian product join (for inner joins and degenerate outer joins)

<li>index join (for LEFT, RIGHT, or INNER join;
single-column equijoin only)

<li>single-column index search; only one index at a time

<li>hybrid Java/Fennel plans

</ul>

<h2>Executor</h2>

<ul>

<li>Row expressions are implemented via a mix of Java code generation
and Fennel calculator programs.  In cases where both implementations
are available for the same value expression, the optimizer decides
(currently always in favor of Fennel; eventually this should be
properly costed).  System parameter "calcVirtualMachine" governs this
behavior (default setting CALCVM_AUTO uses mixed mode; CALCVM_FENNEL
forces Fennel only; CALCVM_JAVA forces Java only, used implicitly when
Fennel support is not available).

<li>Generated Java code is compiled by the Janino compiler (and then
possibly to native code JIT).

<li>All other execution objects are implemented by Fennel, except for
foreign table access (such as MDR or JDBC).

<li>Each DML statement runs in its own implicit subtransaction as required
by the standard.

</ul>

<h2>Management API</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://wiki.eigenbase.org/FarragoSystemManagement">
A variety of management views and procedures</a> are available.

</ul>

<h2>Runtime Modes</h2>

<ul>

<li>Embedded engine:  everything runs in a single process; JDBC calls
go into the engine directly.

<li>Client/server: implemented using <a
href="http://vjdbc.sf.net">VJDBC</a>.  By default, the
server listens for RMI connections on port 5433, and uses multiple
dynamically assigned ports for individual RMI objects.  This can be
controlled via configuration parameters;
<code>serverRmiRegistryPort</code> controls the connection port, and
<code>serverSingleListenerPort</code> forces all RMI objects to
multiplex over a single statically assigned port (default value of
<code>-1</code> means use dynamically assigned ports for this
instead).

</ul>

<h1>What's Broken?</h1>

Besides the absence of important standard stuff like referential
integrity, it's worth mentioning some serious limitations in the
features listed above:

<ul>

<li>REVOKE is not yet implemented, and authorization checks are limited to
table access only (authorization checks for DDL statements is not yet
implemented).  No authentication method is implemented yet.  There are
a number of known security problems in routine invocation, system
routine accessibility, and SQL/MED.

<li>Type inference is missing for some dynamic parameter contexts.

<li><a
href="http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/FarragoCharacterSets">CHARACTER
SET support</a> is limited to LATIN1 (ISO-8859-1) and UTF16 (UNICODE);
collations other than case-sensitive are not supported at all yet.

<li>Bulk load for multi-level trees is implemented internally, but not
yet hooked into CREATE INDEX.

<li>There's no lock manager in the vanilla Farrago session
personality, so concurrency control defaults to dirty read, with the
potential for recovery failures due to write-on-write conflicts.

<li>Updates to unique keys are not ordered correctly, so spurious
uniqueness violations result for a statement like update t set pk=pk+1
(where pk is a primary key).  This probably won't be fixed until
triggers are implemented.

<li>INSERT/UPDATE do not support the explicit DEFAULT keyword.

<li>The SET SCHEMA command cannot be used to set a schema in a
virtual catalog based on a SQL/MED server (including the predefined
SYS_CWM and SYS_FEM catalogs).

<li>There are a number of problems with global temporary table support;
see <a href="http://issues.eigenbase.org/browse/FRG-337">FRG-337</a>
and <a href="http://issues.eigenbase.org/browse/FRG-298">FRG-298</a>.

</ul>

<a href="mailto:perfecthash@users.sf.net">Feedback</a> on anything inaccurate
or missing from these lists is always apppreciated.
