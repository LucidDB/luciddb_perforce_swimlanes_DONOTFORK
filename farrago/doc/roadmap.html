<h1>Farrago Roadmap</h1>

<hr>

Farrago has been under incubation since early in 2003.  We have mainly
focused on getting core functionality working and tested, and have
already exposed the most important extensibility points.  Some basic
features (such as GROUP BY processing) are still under development,
and some (such as the fixed-point NUMERIC datatype) remain missing
entirely.  However, the project is now fleshed out and stable enough
to start encouraging contributions from a wider audience as well as
specializations for various domains.

<p>

The purpose of this roadmap is to sketch out the release plan for 2005
so that we can track progress and prioritize incoming requirements.

<hr>

<h2>First GPL-only Release</h2>

So far, no full Sourceforge releases have been made, and the code has
been developed under a combination of GPL and LGPL licensing due to
the existence of multiple copyright holders.  Once ownership issues
are resolved, The Eigenbase Project will release all code as GPL.
This first official release is targeted to occur by the end of
January, and will make it easier for potential users and contributors
to play with Farrago (without the hassle of using the source control
system).

<p>

TODO: 

<ul>

<li>update binary packaging release scripts

<li>write README and related documents for usage of binary package

<li>create a source packaging script

<li>update getting started docs for working from source distribution
without source control

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Refactoring</h2>

As part of preparing the Farrago platform for use by other projects, we
plan to engage in a comprehensive review process and take stock of the
state of various layers.  This process has several outputs:

<ul>

<li>refactoring tasks for components which need it

<li>documentation on which components and interfaces are safe to
reuse or extend in their current form, which should remain internal to the
framework, and which need to be refactored before being declared
ready for reuse or extension

<li>design documents

<li>incremental releases as refactoring and documentation tasks are completed

</ul>

Important areas known to need work include:

<ul>

<li>validator

<li>dependency tangle within org.eigenbase packages

<li>session interfaces and plugin mechanism

<li>utility classes

<li>catalog extensibility mechanism

<li>parser extensibility mechanism

<li>Java runtime type system

<li>storage management

<li>scheduler resource allocation

</ul>

A possibly realistic goal is to complete the comprehensive review
process by June (including publication of the state of all components)
and complete most of the resulting refactoring tasks by the end of the
year.

<hr>

<h2>Standardization</h2>

In parallel with refactoring, we will be completing our support for
SQL and related standards.  Two startup contributors (codenamed Disruptive
Tech and Red Square) are already at work in this area.  Here are some
of the important missing items:

<ul>

<li>access control (currently owned by the Red Square team)

<li>user-defined functions (currently owned by the Disruptive Tech team)

<li>user-defined types (currently owned by the Disruptive Tech team)

<li>user-defined relational transformations (currently owned by the
Red Square team)

<li>referential integrity

<li>Information Schema views into catalog

<li>complete JDBC metadata support

<li>GROUP BY support (jointly owned by both teams)

<li>MULTISET, ROW, and datetime interval datatypes (currently owned by
the Disruptive Tech team)

<li>fixed-point NUMERIC datatype

<li>ARRAY and LOB datatypes

<li>distributed transaction support

<li>storage management, backup/restore

<li>Fennel persistence for MDR

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Specialization Projects</h2>

Some of the candidate areas for applying the Farrago platform include:

<ul>

<li>federated metadata query server

<li>federated data query server

<li>distributed or replicated DBMS

<li>data warehousing (a Red Square project is currently underway in this area)

<li>pure-Java DBMS (but this space is already very crowded with
open-source projects such as HSQLDB, Derby, and Mckoi)

<li>transaction processing (this space is also very crowded, but
Fennel really just needs a decent concurrency control mechanism to go
here)

<li>active and realtime databases

<li>object/relational (with full SQL-2003 object support)

<li>multimedia, spatial, full-text, temporal

<li>XML

</ul>

As the platform matures, parties interested in spearheading these
efforts can get moving on their own release schedules.
