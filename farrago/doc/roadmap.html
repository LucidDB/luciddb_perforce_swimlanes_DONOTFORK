<h1>Farrago Roadmap</h1>

<hr>

Farrago has been under development since early in 2003.  We have
mainly focused on getting core functionality working and tested, and
have exposed a number of important extensibility points.  The project
is now fleshed out and stable enough to be usable in a wide variety of
domains, but many areas remain to be improved.

<hr>

<h2>Missing or Incomplete Framework Areas</h2>

<ul>

<li>security

<li>domains, user-defined types and aggregates

<li>SQL/J and SQL/PSM

<li>SQL/XML

<li>triggers

<li>referential integrity, CHECK constraints, and assertions

<li>generated columns

<li>Information Schema views into catalog

<li>ARRAY, MULTISET, ROW, and datetime interval datatypes

<li>UNICODE character set and collation support

<li>LOB datatypes

<li>distributed transaction support

<li>concurrency control

<li>storage management, backup/restore

<li>Fennel persistence for MDR

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Specialization Projects</h2>

Some of the candidate areas for applying Farrago include:

<ul>

<li>federated metadata query server

<li>federated data query server

<li>distributed or replicated DBMS

<li>data warehousing (already available with <a
href="http://www.luciddb.org">LucidDB</a>)

<li>pure-Java DBMS (but this space is already very crowded with
open-source projects such as HSQLDB, Derby, and Mckoi)

<li>transaction processing (this space is also very crowded, but
Fennel really just needs a decent concurrency control mechanism to go
here)

<li>active and realtime databases

<li>object/relational (with full SQL-2003 object support)

<li>multimedia, spatial, full-text, temporal

<li>XML query and storage

</ul>
