<h1>LURQL</h1>

LURQL is a specialized language for querying metadata via <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jmi/index.jsp">JMI</a>.  As input,
a LURQL query takes a JMI object extent and its corresponding
metamodel, and as output produces references to the JMI objects which
match the query specification.  LURQL has several special features which
make it the right tool for the job:

<ul>

<li><em>Metamodel-guided query evaluation</em>.  This makes it
possible to express a very generic query such as "retrieve all of the
composite parts of object O as well as any objects which refer to
them" and apply it to an object of any type.  Before execution, the
query processor will automatically filter the metamodel to find the
relevant composite associations.  This also means that if the
metamodel later changes, the query definition does not need to be
modified; new associations will be traversed automatically as
appropriate.

<li><em>Recursion</em>.  This makes it possible to express queries
such as "retrieve a definition for view V as well as all of the
objects it depends on, recursively expanding the definitions for other
views and user-defined functions encountered along the way."

<li><em>Understanding of class hierarchies and associations</em>.
This means that if "materialized view" is a subclass of "view" in the
model being queried in the previous example, the query will work for
materialized views as well, and in addition will pick up any
additional dependencies such as the storage or triggers used to
maintain the materialization.  Further, LURQL has no trouble dealing
with heterogeneous intermediate and final result sets.

</ul>

By contrast, SQL is excellent for querying relational data, but not
for querying the complex object hierarchies and associations typical
of metadata.  (Recent additions of object types and recursive queries
to SQL have improved the expressiveness, but optimizer technology
hasn't caught up enough yet to make usage practical, and
metamodel-guided evaluation is still completely lacking.)  In the
other corner, XQuery is good for semi-structured hierarchical data,
and has some support for recursion, but is not appropriate for
metadata (which has rich graph structure and a well-defined
metamodel).  However, a special-purpose language like LURQL is
necessarily limited in what it can do, and there is much room for
improvement.

<p>

This document presents the syntax and semantics of LURQL along with
examples of how to use it.  It assumes familiarity with UML.  

<h2>Example Model</h2>

As our example metamodel, we use the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/cwm">
Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM)</a>, which defines standard
relational objects such as Schema, Table, View, and Column using UML
concepts such as Namespace, Class, and Attribute as a base.  More
details on Farrago's usage of this model are provided in the <a
href="fem/index.html">Farrago model documentation</a>.

<p>

As sample metadata to be retrieved (instantiating the above
metamodel), we use the <a
href="http://p4web.eigenbase.org/open/dev/farrago/initsql/createSalesSchema.sql">standard
Farrago example schema</a>.  Here's a UML object diagram for the
partial definition of one of the tables (including its containers,
columns, and their datatypes):

<p>

<h2>Simple Queries</h2>

Here's our first LURQL query, which finds a table by name together with
all of its columns:

<pre><code>
select * 
from class Table 
where name = 'DEPTS' 
then (
    follow association ClassifierFeature
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
LocalTable: DEPTS
StoredColumn: DEPTNO
StoredColumn: NAME
</code></pre>

As you can see, LURQL uses a SQL-ish <code>select/from/where</code>
structure, but the resemblance is only superficial.  LURQL queries
have a mapping to the directed graph structure of the metamodel of
interest.  In this case, we are starting from the extent of all
tables, filtering down to just those tables whose name matches the
string literal 'DEPTS', and then following the association
ClassifierFeature to pick up the corresponding columns.  The result
set is a collection of JMI objects (one table and two columns); we
only display the object types and names in this document, but the
actual return value is a reference to the live object in the
repository (from which all of its attributes and links are
accessible).  Note that the actual type returned for DEPTS
(LocalTable) is a subtype of the requested CWM type (Table); LURQL
automatically includes all subtypes in its search.

<p>

Unlike SQL, the <code>*</code> in the <code>select</code> clause does
not project attributes; instead, it projects entire nodes of the query
graph.  For example, if we only wanted to retrieve the columns:

<pre><code>
select c
from class Table as t where name='DEPTS' then (
    follow association ClassifierFeature as c
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
StoredColumn: DEPTNO
StoredColumn: NAME
</code></pre>

The <code>as</code> clause can be used to apply a label to each
<code>from</code> or <code>follow</code> clause.  In this case the
label "t" is unused and is only specified as a syntax example.  For
follow clauses, the label is applied to the set of classes reached via
the association (or associations) traversed (StoredColumn for c).

<p>

Follow clauses can be chained to arbitrary depth.  For example, to
retrieve the schema and table containing column EMPNO:

<pre><code>
select s, t
from class Column where name='EMPNO' then (
    follow association ClassifierFeature as t then (
        follow association ElementOwnership backward as s
    )
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
LocalSchema: SALES
LocalTable: EMPS
LocalTable: TEMPS
View: EMPSVIEW
View: TEMPSVIEW
</code></pre>

Wait, where did those extra objects come from?  It turns out that
there are four different objects in schema SALES with columns named
EMPNO: two tables (EMPS and TEMPS) and two views (EMPSVIEW and
TEMPSVIEW).  LURQL followed all of these paths from the root column
object EMPNO, and then merged all of them at the single parent schema
(duplicates are always removed from the final result set).

<p>

Note that the query above specified the <code>backward</code>
qualifier on the traversal of association ElementOwnership, which is
what takes us from table to containing schema.  The reason is that the
ElementOwnership association also links tables to other objects such
as constraints and dependencies.  LURQL imposes direction on the
underlying metamodel as follows:

<ul>

<li>for a composite association, "forward" means "from container to contained"

<li>otherwise, for a 1-to-many association, "forward" means "from one to many"

<li>otherwise, for an ordered association, "forward" means "from
non-ordered end to ordered end"

<li>as a fallback, "forward" means "from first end to second
end" (end assignment is somewhat arbitrary in many UML models, so this isn't
guaranteed to be useful)

</ul>

In this case, we happen to know that the only traversal we are
interested in follows the backward direction.  As contrast, here are the
query results without the directional qualifier:

<pre><code>
select s, t
from class Column where name='EMPNO' then (
    follow association ClassifierFeature as t then (
        follow association ElementOwnership as s
    )
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
Dependency: EMPS$DEP
Dependency: EMPSVIEW$DEP
Dependency: TEMPS$DEP
Dependency: TEMPSVIEW$DEP
LocalSchema: SALES
LocalTable: EMPS
LocalTable: TEMPS
PrimaryKeyConstraint: SYS$PRIMARY_KEY
PrimaryKeyConstraint: SYS$PRIMARY_KEY
UniqueKeyConstraint: SYS$UNIQUE_KEY$EMPID
View: EMPSVIEW
View: TEMPSVIEW
</code></pre>

Direction is not the only qualifier available for filtering
association traversals.  The others are covered in some of the later
examples as well as the formal syntax.

<h2>Divergence and Convergence</h2>

In the previous example, we saw how LURQL can follow many different
links in parallel, all matching a single <code>follow</code> clause.
It is also possible to explicitly specify more than one
<code>follow</code> branching out from the same origin along different
associations.  For example, suppose we'd like to find the datatype and
containing tables of a column:

<pre><code>
select t, d
from class Column where name='CITY' then (
    follow destination class Table as t
    union
    follow destination class SQLDataType as d
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
LocalTable: EMPS
LocalTable: TEMPS
SQLSimpleType: VARCHAR
</code></pre>

The keyword <code>union</code> is used because the final results are
based on the two paths combined (with duplicates removed as always).
Intersect and other set operations are not currently supported.  The
<code>follow</code> qualifier used here is based on the
<code>class</code> (Table or SQLDataType) reached rather than the
association.  The <code>destination</code> qualifier means filter
based on the class reached rather than the starting class (the
<code>origin</code> qualifier provides this alternative).

<p>

The example above shows diverging paths; it is also possible for paths
to converge and then carry on together.  Suppose we'd like to query the
union of the columns of view EMPSVIEW and table DEPTS in schema SALES:

<pre><code>
select c
from class Schema where name='SALES' then (
    follow destination class Table where name='DEPTS' 
    union
    follow destination class View where name='EMPSVIEW'
) gather then (
    follow destination class Column as c
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
StoredColumn: DEPTNO
StoredColumn: NAME
ViewColumn: EMPNO
ViewColumn: NAME
</code></pre>

The <code>gather</code> clause combines the leaves of the unioned
paths and then applies the last <code>then</code> clause to that
combination.  Schematically:

<p>

<img src="lurqlDiagrams/gather.gif">

<p>

In some cases, a query may need to contain excursions; the
<code>gather with parent</code> variation can be used for this
purpose.  For example, suppose we want to query the columns of a view
together with all columns of directly underlying tables:

<pre><code>
select c, t
from class View where name='JOINVIEW' then (
    follow association ElementOwnership destination class Dependency then (
        follow destination end supplier destination class Table as t
    )
) gather with parent then (
    follow association ClassifierFeature as c
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
LocalTable: DEPTS
LocalTable: EMPS
StoredColumn: AGE
StoredColumn: CITY
StoredColumn: DEPTNO
StoredColumn: DEPTNO
StoredColumn: EMPID
StoredColumn: EMPNO
StoredColumn: GENDER
StoredColumn: MANAGER
StoredColumn: NAME
StoredColumn: NAME
StoredColumn: PUBLIC_KEY
StoredColumn: SLACKER
ViewColumn: DNAME
ViewColumn: ENAME
</code></pre>

The first <code>follow</code> chain defines the view dependency
traversal (and demonstrates association filtering via end names).  It
is an "excursion" in the sense that regardless of what it finds, we
also want to include the original view (the "parent") as a source for
the final <code>follow</code> after the <code>gather with
parent</code>.  Here's the corresponding query graph:

<p>

<img src="lurqlDiagrams/gatherWithParent.gif">

<h2>Recursion</h2>

The examples so far have contained query graphs which match the
structure of the underlying metamodel exactly.  If the structure is
complex, this may be cumbersome (consider enumerating all of the parts
of an object such as a table).  And in some cases, the structure may
be recursive, allowing chains of arbitrary depth.  To address these
requirements, LURQL provides recursion.  Here's a simple example which
expands all of the containers of a table:

<pre><code>
select *
from class Table where name='TEMPS' then (
    recursively (
        follow composite backward
    )
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
LocalCatalog: LOCALDB
LocalSchema: SALES
LocalTable: TEMPS
</code></pre>

The query did not mention any particular association or class other
than Table; the structure was discovered automatically by query execution.

<p>

Recursion may contain follow chains (or diverging chains as long as
they all eventually converge back to a single endpoint) and may be
followed by more non-recursive query processing.  Here's the previous
view dependency example, this time capable of handling arbitrary depth
(the results are not shown since the example views only have one
level):

<pre><code>
select c, t
from class View where name='JOINVIEW' then (
    recursively (
        follow association ElementOwnership destination class Dependency then (
            follow destination end supplier destination class ColumnSet as t
        )
    )
) gather with parent then (
    follow association ClassifierFeature as c
);
</code></pre>

Note that the dependency destination has been changed from Table to
ColumnSet (which includes the views we want to recursively expand).
Such a recursive query can be diagrammed as a cyclic graph:

<p>

<img src="lurqlDiagrams/recursion.gif">

<h2>Existence Filters</h2>

So far we have seen how LURQL can navigate complex models, but the
filtering performed during navigation has been very localized.  LURQL
supports an <code>exists</code> clause for filtering based on the
existence of related objects.

<p>

Suppose we'd like to find all schemas which contain tables named 'EMPS':

<pre><code>
select s
from class Schema as s where exists (
    follow association ElementOwnership destination class Table 
    where name='EMPS'
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
LocalSchema: SALES
</code></pre>

By default, exists tests whether results are found for any node in the
subquery (which can contain any kind of LURQL construct, including
union and recursion).  For more selective existence tests, it is
possible to make the decision based on a select list.  Suppose we'd
like to find tables with columns of type BOOLEAN:

<pre><code>
select t
from class Table as t where exists d in (
    follow association ClassifierFeature then (
        follow destination class SQLDataType as d
        where name='BOOLEAN'
    )
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
LocalTable: EMPS
LocalTable: TEMPS
</code></pre>

If multiple variables are specified in the select list, then the
existence test passes if any of them return at least one
result. (Union rather than intersection.)

<h2>SQL Integration</h2>

At times it can be useful to complement LURQL with SQL.  When properly
configured, a LURQL query processor can use SQL queries as sources for
filter lists.  Here's an example of how to get the datatypes for all
columns having a name ending with 'NO':

<pre><code>
select dt
from class Column where mofId in
[select "mofId" from sys_cwm."Relational"."Column" where "name" like '%NO']
then (
    follow destination class SQLDataType as dt
);

EXECUTION RESULT:
SQLSimpleType: INTEGER
</code></pre>

Any query text in between square brackets is not parsed by LURQL; it
is instead sent to the configured SQL connection for execution.  The
SQL query should return a result set with exactly one column.

<p>

In this case, the SQL query is against the catalog views derived from the
same metadata being queried by LURQL.  The "mofId" column is a special
internal column representing the JMI object ID.

<h2>History and Credits</h2>

<img src="berql.gif" align="right">

LURQL was originally developed in 1998 under the name BERQL by <a
href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~royg">Roy Goldman</a>, John Sichi,
and others at Broadbase Software.  BERQL was an acronym for Broadbase
Entity Relationship Query Language, but there also happens to be a
restaurant on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley named Berkel Berkel.  The
original implementation of the language didn't have its own parser;
instead, queries were phrased in XML (just like <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xqueryx">XQueryX</a>), which was nice for
machines but no so nice for humans.

<p>

In 2005, the code was contributed under GPL licensing to The Eigenbase
Project via LucidEra, a startup which has acquired the rights to the
Broadbase code.  Besides rechristening as LURQL, major changes from
BERQL include:

<ul>

<li>a human-friendly grammar and JavaCC parser

<li>sourcing from standard JMI metadata instead of the proprietary
Broadbase repository

<li>support for execution of SQL queries to produce filter values

<li>support for merging paths from different roots

<li>new name, even more fun to say aloud

</ul>
