<h1>Overview</h1> 

This document describes how logical Farrago table definitions are
mapped to the default BTree-based reference implementation known as
FTRS (Fennel Transactional Row Store).  It is possible to plug in
other mappings such as <a href="http://www.luciddb.org">column-based
storage</a> using the CREATE LOCAL DATA WRAPPER command.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

Every FTRS table must have a primary key and exactly one clustered
index (which need not be unique, and need not include the primary
key).  When a clustered index definition is omitted, the primary key
is used.  A table may have any number of unclustered indexes, both
unique and non-unique.

<p>

The primary key requirement is not standard SQL (even though it ought
to be).  Eventually omission of a primary key will be allowed, and will
result in generation of a hidden system-owned surrogate key.

<h2>Example DDL</h2>

We'll use a single table as an example:

<pre><code>
create table ENLISTMENT(
    NAME varchar(128) not null,
    RANK char(3),
    SERIALNO integer not null constraint SERIALNO_PK primary key,
    PLATOONID integer not null)

create clustered index ENLISTMENT_CX on ENLISTMENT(NAME)

create index ENLISTMENT_PLATOONID on ENLISTMENT(PLATOONID)

</code></pre>

Since unique constraints result in the creation of system-owned unique
indexes for enforcement, three indexes result from this DDL statement.
The constraint index will be referred to by its constraint name (SERIALNO_PK).

<p>

Each index has a <em>defined key</em> which is the column list
specified by the DDL statement which created the index.  For this example:

<ul>

<li>The defined key of SERIALNO_PK is (SERIALNO).

<li>The defined key of ENLISTMENT_CX is (NAME).

<li>The defined key of ENLISTMENT_PLATOONID is (PLATOONID).

</ul>

<h2>Clustered Index Storage</h2>

The clustered index is implemented as a BTree which stores all of the
table data in the order specified by the index definition.  Here's
some example data as it would be stored in the clustered index:

<table border="1">

<tr>
<td>NAME</td>
<td>RANK</td>
<td>SERIALNO</td>
<td>PLATOONID</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Boyle</td>
<td>CPL</td>
<td>1004</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Carter</td>
<td>SGT</td>
<td>1001</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Carter</td>
<td>PVT</td>
<td>1003</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Lombardi</td>
<td>PVT</td>
<td>1002</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Pyle</td>
<td>PVT</td>
<td>1000</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>

Note that there is a duplicate in the defined key NAME of the clustered
index.  This is allowed since the clustered index was not specified as
unique.  However, we need a unique locator for every tuple stored, so
we introduce the concept of an index's <em>distinct key</em>.  For a
unique index, this is identical to the defined key.  For a non-unique
clustered index, we append the columns of the primary key (leaving out
any that were already referenced by the defined key).  In this
example, the distinct key for ENLISTMENT_CX is (NAME, SERIALNO).

<h2>Unclustered Index Storage</h2>

The distinct key for a clustered index can be thought of as a logical
ROWID.  In fact, this is how it is used when an unclustered index is
stored.  Each tuple in the BTree implementing an unclustered index
consists of the unclustered index's defined key plus the columns of
the clustered index's distinct key (again leaving out any redundant
columns from the unclustered index's defined key).  Here is the data
stored for SERIALNO_PK:

<table border="1">

<tr>
<td>SERIALNO</td>
<td>NAME</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1000</td>
<td>Pyle</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1001</td>
<td>Carter</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1002</td>
<td>Lombardi</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1003</td>
<td>Carter</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1004</td>
<td>Boyle</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>

Note that in this case, adding on the clustered index key does not make the
unclustered index key "more unique" since it is already unique; but
it does give us an indirect access path from SERIALNO to tuple:  first
search SERIALNO_PK to convert the SERIALNO into a NAME, and then use
the (NAME,SERIALNO) combination to search ENLISTMENT_CX, which stores the
values for all other columns.

<p>

For non-unique index ENLISTMENT_PLATOONID, adding on the distinct key
of the clustered index serves both purposes:

<table border="1">

<tr>
<td>PLATOONID</td>
<td>NAME</td>
<td>SERIALNO</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Lombardi</td>
<td>1002</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Pyle</td>
<td>1000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Boyle</td>
<td>1004</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Carter</td>
<td>1001</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Carter</td>
<td>1003</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>

In this case of a non-unique unclustered index, the full tuple stored
in the BTree forms the distinct key for the unclustered index.  To
summarize distinct keys:

<ul>

<li>The distinct key of SERIALNO_PK is (SERIALNO).

<li>The distinct key of ENLISTMENT_CX is (NAME,SERIALNO).

<li>The distinct key of ENLISTMENT_PLATOONID is (PLATOONID,NAME,SERIALNO).

</ul>


<h2>Index Coverage</h2>

When processing a query, the optimizer chooses an access path based on
what indexes are available.  A filter on the clustered index defined
key can be implemented as a direct search against the clustered
index.  For example,

<pre><code>
select NAME,RANK,SERIALNO
from ENLISTMENT
where NAME='Pyle'

</code></pre>

A filter on an unclustered index normally requires an indirect search
as described previously.  However, if the unclustered index "covers"
all columns referenced by the query, then a direct search can be used
and the clustered index can be ignored.  For example,

<pre><code>
select NAME
from ENLISTMENT
where SERIALNO=1000
</pre></code>

In this case, SERIALNO_PK can be used for a direct lookup.

<p>

So, the <em>coverage</em> for a clustered index is the entire table,
while the coverage for an unclustered index is the combination of its
defined key with the distinct key of the clustered index.  

Examples:

<ul>

<li>The coverage of SERIALNO_PK is (SERIALNO,NAME).

<li>The coverage of ENLISTMENT_CX is (NAME,RANK,SERIALNO,PLATOONID).

<li>The coverage of ENLISTMENT_PLATOONID is (PLATOONID,NAME,SERIALNO).

</ul>

<h2>Collation Key</h2>

In addition to coverage, the optimizer is also interested in sort
order (e.g. for satisfying ORDER BY or merge join requirements).  For
each index, a <em>collation key</em> can be defined which is the list
of columns according to which tuples are guaranteed to be returned in
order by a sequential scan of the index.  For a clustered index, this
is identical to the distinct key.  For an unclustered index, the
collation key is identical to the coverage.

Examples:

<ul>

<li>The collation key of SERIALNO_PK is (SERIALNO,NAME).

<li>The collation key of ENLISTMENT_CX is (NAME,SERIALNO).

<li>The collation key of ENLISTMENT_PLATOONID is (PLATOONID,NAME,SERIALNO).

</ul>
