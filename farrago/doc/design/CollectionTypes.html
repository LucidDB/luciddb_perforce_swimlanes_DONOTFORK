<h1>SQL Standard Collection Types</h1>

This document describes standard support for collection types in SQL99
and SQL2003.  The specifications are informal; for details, see the
relevant portions of the standards.  None of this is implemented in
Farrago yet.

<h2>SQL99 Array Type</h2>

SQL99 introduces limited support for a single collection type known as
arrays.  Arrays are variable-sized ordered collections with a declared
maximum cardinality.  Here's an example of how to declare a column
with array type:

<pre><code>
CREATE TABLE genome_sequences(
    sequence_id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    chromosome_number INT NOT NULL,
    start_offset BIGINT NOT NULL,
    codons CHAR(3) ARRAY[1000] NOT NULL);
</code></pre>

Elements of the array may be declared with almost any datatype (in
this example, <code>CHAR(3)</code>).  However, in SQL99, nested arrays
are illegal (whether the nesting is direct or indirect); you can't
declare 

<pre><code>
    illegal_column1 INT ARRAY[3] ARRAY[5]
</code></pre>

nor can you declare

<pre><code>
    illegal_column2 ROW(INT,DOUBLE ARRAY[7]) ARRAY[4]
</code></pre>

(This restriction is removed by SQL2003.)

<p>

Array values are created with the ARRAY constructor:

<pre><code>
INSERT INTO genome_sequences VALUES(
    10032423, 3, 432432, 
    ARRAY['CUG', 'AAG', 'GGU', 'ACU', 'CUU', 'GGU', 'UGG', 'UAA']);
</code></pre>

The length of an array is retrieved with the CARDINALITY function:

<pre><code>
SELECT sequence_id,CARDINALITY(codons) as sequence_length
FROM genome_sequences
ORDER BY sequence_length;
</code></pre>

And the actual values can be selected with the usual bracket syntax:

<pre><code>
SELECT 
    sequence_id,
    codons[1] as first_codon,
    codons[CARDINALITY(codons)] as last_codon
FROM genome_sequences
ORDER BY sequence_id;
</code></pre>

Notice that array offsets are 1-based.  Attempting to read an
out-of-bound offset (or to write an offset past the maximum
cardinality) results in an exception.  Any element of an array may be
null, and there is no straightforward means of declaring them NOT
NULL.  Updating an element past the current cardinality automatically
extends the array and sets any new elements thus created to null.

<p>

Arrays can be concatenated with the usual notation:

<pre><code>
CREATE VIEW spliced_sequences AS
SELECT s1.sequence_id, s1.codons || s2.codons AS spliced_codons
FROM genome_sequences s1, genome_sequences s2
WHERE s1.chromosome_number = s2.chromosome_number
AND s2.start_offset = s1.start_offset + CARDINALITY(s1.codons);
</code></pre>

Array elements can be
set individually in the SET clause of an UPDATE statement, or the
entire array can be set as the target of an INSERT or UPDATE:

<pre><code>
UPDATE genome_sequences
SET codons = 
    (SELECT codons 
     FROM spliced_sequences 
     WHERE spliced_sequences.sequence_id = genome_sequences.sequence_id);
</code></pre>

Array assignment in which the maximum size of the target is less than
the actual size of a source value results in an exception.  In the
example above, this will occur if two sequences spliced together make
up a sequence longer than 1000 codons.

<p>

Arrays can be compared for exact match with = or &lt;&gt;:

<pre><code>
CREATE VIEW matching_sequences AS
SELECT s1.sequence_id as sid1, s2.sequence_id as sid2
FROM genome_sequences s1, genome_sequences s2
WHERE s1.codons = s2.codons;
</code></pre>

No other inequality operator is supported, and usage of arrays in just
about any other context (including GROUP BY) is illegal.

The UNNEST operator converts an array into a query expression:

<pre><code>
-- convert a particular sequence into a table
SELECT codon,offset
FROM UNNEST((SELECT codons FROM genome_sequences WHERE sequence_id = 10032423))
     WITH ORDINALITY 
     AS codon_table(codon,offset)
ORDER BY offset
</code></pre>

The WITH ORDINALITY clause specifies that the array ordering should be
used to derive the offset column.  Without this clause, the codons
would be returned without any ordering information.

What if we wanted to convert all of the sequences together?
That's what the new LATERAL derived table feature is for:

<pre><code>
SELECT 
    g.sequence_id,
    codon_table.codon,
    codon_table.offset as relative_offset,
    g.start_offset + codon_table.offset - 1 as absolute_offset
FROM 
    genome_sequences g,
    LATERAL(UNNEST(g.codons) WITH ORDINALITY)
    AS codon_table(codon,offset)
WHERE chromosome_number = 7
ORDER BY absolute_offset,sequence_id
</code></pre>

This should result in a table containing all of the codons from
chromosome #7.  The first column is the sequence containing the codon.
The second column is the codon itself.  The third column is the
relative offset of the codon within the sequence.  The last column is
the absolute offset of the codon within the chromosome.  Returned rows are
ordered by absolute position.

<p>

Note that the new LATERAL keyword is normally required in order to
reference a table expression defined earlier in the FROM list
(<code>g</code> in this example).  However, when UNNEST is specified,
LATERAL is implicit.

<h2>SQL2003 Array Type</h2>

SQL2003 extends array semantics in a number of ways.  Arrays can be
declared without a maximum cardinality, in which case the maximum is
vendor-defined (possibly unbounded like a LOB).  Array nesting is
unrestricted.  And a new constructor is added for converting a query
into an array:

<pre><code>
INSERT INTO listbox_choices VALUES(
    'Department Names',ARRAY(SELECT name FROM sales.depts ORDER BY 1));
</pre></code>

<h2>SQL2003 Multiset Type</h2>

SQL2003 also introduces another collection type known as a multiset.
A multiset is much like an array, but unordered, and has more useful
operators.  Although multisets and arrays are both collections, they
don't mix (e.g. you can't INSERT a multiset into an array column).

<p>

Unlike arrays, multisets never have a declared maximum cardinality:

<pre><code>
CREATE TABLE logins(
    session_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    successful BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    uid INT,
    attempts ROW(VARCHAR(128),VARCHAR(128) MULTISET);
</code></pre>

Multiset constructors are similar to array constructors:

<pre><code>

INSERT INTO logins VALUES(
    1000,true,0,
    MULTISET(
        ROW('root','31337'), 
        ROW('scott','tiger'), 
        ROW('root','beer')));

INSERT INTO logins VALUES(
    1001,false,0,MULTISET(SELECT ROW(name,password) FROM bogus_accounts));

</code></pre>

(Note that ORDER BY is not allowed on a multiset constructor query
since multisets are unordered.)  As syntactic sugar, another
constructor named TABLE is also provided which automatically converts
a query into a multiset of rows.  The next example is equivalent to
the previous query-based MULTISET constructor:

<pre><code>
INSERT INTO logins VALUES(
    1001,false,0,TABLE(SELECT name,password FROM bogus_accounts));
</code></pre>

<p>

CARDINALITY returns the total number of elements in a multiset (not
the number of distinct elements).  Multisets cannot be concatenated
(since they aren't ordered); instead, a number of set operators are
provided for multisets:

<pre><code>

multiset1 MULTISET UNION [ALL|DISTINCT] multiset2

multiset1 MULTISET INTERSECT [ALL|DISTINCT] multiset2

multiset1 MULTISET EXCEPT [ALL|DISTINCT] multiset2

</code></pre>

Some multiset-specific predicates are also provided:

<pre><code>

-- find sessions with a particular username/password combination
SELECT session_id
FROM logins
WHERE ROW('root','31337') MEMBER OF attempts;

-- find sessions where no combination was retried
SELECT session_id
FROM logins
WHERE attempts IS A SET;

-- find sessions whose attempted combinations subsume those of other sessions
SELECT a.session_id as sub_id,b.session_id as super_id
FROM logins a,logins b
WHERE a.attempts SUBMULTISET OF b.attempts;

</code></pre>

UNNEST can be used on a multiset (but not WITH ORDINALITY, obviously).
The multiset-specific ELEMENT operator converts a multiset with
cardinality 1 into a row expression:

<pre><code>
SELECT session_id,ELEMENT(attempts).name
FROM logins
WHERE CARDINALITY(attempts) = 1;
</code></pre>

Finally, aggregation operators are provided for collecting row values
into multisets, and for aggregating multisets:

<pre><code>
SELECT 
    uid,
    COLLECT(session_id) AS session_ids,
    FUSION(attempts) AS all_attempts,
    INTERSECTION(attempts) AS common_attempts
FROM logins
WHERE successful
GROUP BY uid;
</code></pre>

For each user, the query above returns a row with the uid key and three
multiset columns.  The <code>session_ids</code> column contains a
multiset of the sessions which successfully logged in that uid.  The
<code>all_attempts</code> column contains a multiset of all of the
username/password combinations used for that uid.  The
<code>common_attempts</code> column contains a multiset of any
username/password combinations which were tried for all logins of that
uid.
