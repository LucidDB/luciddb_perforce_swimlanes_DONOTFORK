<h1>Farrago SQL/MED Support</h1>

This document describes Farrago support for SQL/MED
(Management of External Data), the portion of the SQL99 standard which
governs access to foreign data (both relational
and non-relational) hosted in other servers.

<h2>Overview</h2>

SQL/MED defines several very independent interfaces:

<ul>

<li>An SQL DDL interface for defining access to foreign data.

<li>An underlying programming-language-neutral service provider
interface to be implemented by foreign data wrappers (drivers for
various kinds of data).  This interface is wide, complex, and
non-trivial to implement.  For example, in order to support metadata
import, an implementation must support SQL queries against the
standard INFORMATION_SCHEMA (probably not something the developer of a
flat-file driver wants to deal with).

<li>Datalink interfaces (not covered in this document).

</ul>

Farrago supports the standard DDL interface but not (currently) the
standard foreign data wrapper service provider interface.  Instead,
Farrago defines a somewhat simpler non-standard service provider
interface together with some prepackaged implementations:

<ul>

<li>FTRS: for access to data stored by Fennel in
transactional row format.  This is not really foreign data, but is
represented as such for architectural uniformity.  A normal CREATE
TABLE statement uses this implicitly.  The CREATE TABLE
statement has been extended to allow creation of other types of table
storage (e.g. FCS for Fennel column-store format).

<li>
<a href="medjdbc.html">JDBC</a>: for access to data stored in foreign
SQL databases.

<li>MDR:  for access to metadata stored in an MDR repository
(including Farrago's own system catalog).

</ul>

Eventually, if standard SQL/MED foreign data wrapper drivers become
popular, Farrago will either provide a bridge for them as another
implementation of its non-standard interface, or will make its own
non-standard interface obsolete.  The standard DDL will remain
unchanged in any event.

<h2>Foreign Data Wrapper Definition</h2>

The standard SQL/MED DDL statement to install a driver is CREATE
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER foreign-data-wrapper-name
[ LIBRARY 'libraryName' ]
LANGUAGE language-name
[ OPTIONS ( opt-name1 'opt-value1' [, opt-name2 'opt-value2' ... ] ) ]
</code></pre>

Initially, Farrago requires the LANGUAGE to be JAVA.  The LIBRARY name
specifies the path to a JAR containing the wrapper implementation.
Here's a fictitious example for a foreign data wrapper capable of fetching XML
files via TCP/IP:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER xml_tcpip
LIBRARY '/home/jvs/wrappers/FarragoXmlSourceReader.jar'
LANGUAGE JAVA
OPTIONS ( protocol 'TCP/IP' )
</code></pre>

According to the standard, foreign data wrappers are catalog objects.
In Farrago, they are implicitly created under the SYS_BOOT catalog
(and so must have top-level unique names).

<p>

As an extension, Farrago also allows a foreign data wrapper to be
specified as the fully-qualified name of a class available on
the server's classpath (instead of in a particular JAR file):

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER xml_
LIBRARY 'class com.yoyodyne.farrago.plugin.xml.FarragoXmlDataWrapper'
LANGUAGE JAVA
OPTIONS ( protocol 'TCP/IP' )
</code></pre>

<h2>Foreign Server Definition</h2>

Once a foreign data wrapper has been installed, it can be bound to data
provided by a particular server with the CREATE SERVER statement:

<pre><code>
CREATE SERVER foreign-server-name
[ TYPE 'server-type' ]
[ VERSION 'server-version' ]
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER foreign-data-wrapper-name
[ OPTIONS ( ... ) ]
</code></pre>

Example using the previously defined wrapper:

<pre><code>
CREATE SERVER movie_catalog
TYPE 'ANY'
VERSION '1.1'
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER xml_tcpip
OPTIONS ( url 'http://www.movie-fun-facts.org' )
</code></pre>

Any type of web server would be allowed, but it would have to support
HTTP version 1.1 (and the wrapper would expect HTTP features to work
accordingly).  As with foreign data wrappers, foreign servers are
created under the SYS_BOOT catalog, and their names must not conflict
with any other server (or catalog) in the system.

<p>

According to the SQL/MED standard, defining a foreign server does not
make its data accessible (the CREATE FOREIGN TABLE or IMPORT FOREIGN
SCHEMA statements described later are required first).  However,
Farrago introduces a non-standard mechanism for direct access.  Each
foreign server defined implies a corresponding top-level virtual
catalog.  These catalogs are virtual in the sense that no local
metadata is stored for them (and no INFORMATION_SCHEMA is defined).
Instead, metadata is acquired on-the-fly during query processing.  For
example, after the above CREATE SERVER example, the following query
might be legal:

<pre><code>
SELECT DISTINCT r.name
FROM movie_catalog.review_facts.reviewers r,
     movie_catalog.movie_facts.actors a
WHERE r.name=a.name
</code></pre>

This queries the names of all actors who have the same names as movie
reviewers.  The FarragoXmlSourceReader wrapper implementation might map
each subdirectory under the root URL to a schema, and xml files in those
subdirectories to tables.  However, a metadata query like

<pre><code>
SELECT * 
FROM movie_catalog.information_schema.table
</code></pre>

would fail unless the FarragoXmlSourceReader implementation happened
to support the INFORMATION_SCHEMA (unlikely in this case, but more
likely for a JDBC foreign data wrapper).

<p>

Virtual catalogs are read-only (it is not possible to create new
schemas, tables, or other objects under them).

<h2>Foreign Table Definition</h2>

In order for metadata about a foreign table to be stored in the
LOCALDB catalog, a CREATE FOREIGN TABLE statement is required:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE table-name
SERVER foreign-server-name
[ ( basic-column-definition1 [, basic-column-definition2 ... ] ) ]
[ OPTIONS ( ... ) ]

</code></pre>

A basic-column-definition consists of a name, a datatype, and (optionally)
a column-level OPTIONS clause.

<p>

For example:

<pre><code>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE movie_schema.reviewers
SERVER movie_catalog
OPTIONS ( directory 'review_facts', file 'reviewers.xml' )
</code></pre>

Here, the foreign XML file previously referenced implicitly (via SQL
identifiers in the virtual catalog) is now referenced explicitly (via
wrapper-specific options).  The local schema MOVIE_SCHEMA must already
exist under the LOCALDB catalog.  Since column definitions were
omitted, the wrapper must be capable of deriving these automatically
from the XML file contents.  Now, we can issue a query like

<pre><code>
SELECT * 
FROM movie_schema.reviewers
</code></pre>

or a metadata query like

<pre><code>
SELECT column_name
FROM localhost.information_schema
WHERE table_schema = 'MOVIE_SCHEMA' 
AND table_name = 'REVIEWERS'
</code></pre>

<h2>Foreign Schema Import</h2>

In order to import metadata for a large number of tables at once, SQL/MED
provides the IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA statement (not yet supported by Farrago):

<pre><code>
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA foreign-schema-name
[ LIMIT TO ( table1 [, table2 ... ] ) | EXCEPT ( table3 [, table4 ... ] ) ]
FROM SERVER foreign-server-name
INTO local-schema-name
</code></pre>

For the running example:

<pre><code>
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA movie_facts
FROM SERVER movie_catalog
INTO localhost.movie_schema
</code></pre>

Note that as with CREATE FOREIGN TABLE, local schema MOVIE_SCHEMA must
already exist before the IMPORT statement is executed.

<h2>Additional DDL</h2>

SQL/MED defines statements such as DROP/ALTER for foreign data
wrappers, servers, and tables.  It also defines additional DDL for
controlling mapping of users and routines.  For the details, consult
the standard.  Currently, Farrago only supports CREATE/DROP.

<h2>Java Interfaces</h2>

The interfaces which must be implemented in order to write a new
foreign data wrapper are defined in 
<a 
href="../api/net/sf/farrago/namespace/package-summary.html#package_description">
package net.sf.farrago.namespace</a>.  Abstract bases in <a
href="../api/net/sf/farrago/namespace/impl/package-summary.html#package_description">package
net.sf.farrago.namespace.impl</a> ease the construction of new
wrappers.  It is currently a fairly difficult task to develop a new
wrapper; eventually a stripped down service provider interface may be
defined to make it easier to wrap simple data.  Another option for
some types of data is to acquire a JDBC driver and use 
<a href="medjdbc.html">Farrago's JDBC wrapper</a>.

<h2>Repository Model</h2>

Since CWM does not cover any SQL/MED metadata, the repository model
for foreign data is defined in the Farrago extension model (FEM).  Each
foreign table has an association with a corresponding foreign
server, together with options specified when it was created.  Catalog
initialization also creates a representation for the local server,
to which tables stored locally are attached.  Catalog
initialization creates virtual catalogs for the local MDR
repository metadata (using MedMdrForeignDataWrapper).  Below is a
UML structure diagram for the SQL/MED model:

The two associations (WrapperAccessesServer and ServerStoresTable) also
imply dependencies for DROP RESTRICT/CASCADE.
