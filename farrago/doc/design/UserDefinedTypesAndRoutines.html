<h1>SQL Standard User Defined Types and Routines</h1>

This document describes standard support for user-defined types and
routines in SQL99.  The specifications are informal; for details, see
the relevant portions of the standard.  None of this is implemented in
Farrago yet.


<h2>User-Defined Types</h2>

In SQL99, it's possible to extend the type system in a number of ways:

<ul>

<li>The traditional concept of a <em>domain</em> is preserved from
SQL92.  A domain is not actually a user-defined type; it's really just
an alias for a combination of a builtin type with a default value and
a set of constraints.  A column based on a domain can be assigned and
compared with values of the underlying builtin type directly; there's
no need (or even mechanism) to convert between the domain and the
builtin type.  Domains cannot be used to declare anything but columns;
e.g. you can't declare a parameter to an SQL routine as a domain.

<li>The simplest kind of user-defined type is a <em>distinct
type</em>.  Like a domain, a distinct type is defined in terms of a
single builtin type.  Unlike a domain, a distinct type is not directly
assignable or comparable with the underlying builtin type or other
distinct types based on it.  Instead, explicit conversions are
required.  The canonical example for why distinct types are a good
idea is the Mars Climate Orbiter, which crashed due to an error from
mixing imperial and metric units without conversion.  Here's a simple
example of distinct type definition:

<pre><code>
CREATE TYPE metric_meter AS DOUBLE;
CREATE TYPE imperial_foot AS DOUBLE;
</code></pre>

<li>More generally, a <em>structured type</em> is defined much like a
class in an object-oriented programming language such as C++ or Java.
A structured type is defined with an arbitrary number of attributes of
any type (including user-defined types), and may optionally inherit
from another structured type (single-inheritance only).  Types may be
FINAL or NOT FINAL (as with the Java <code>final</code> modifier) and
INSTANTIABLE or NOT INSTANTIABLE (as with the Java
<code>abstract</code> modifier).  Here's the classic OO example:

<pre><code>

CREATE TYPE Shape2D
NOT INSTANTIABLE
NOT FINAL;

CREATE TYPE Circle UNDER Shape2D
AS(
    radius DOUBLE DEFAULT 1
)
INSTANTIABLE
FINAL;

CREATE TYPE Rectangle UNDER Shape2D
NOT INSTANTIABLE
NOT FINAL;

CREATE TYPE Square UNDER Rectangle
AS(
    side_length DOUBLE DEFAULT 1
)
INSTANTIABLE
FINAL;

CREATE TYPE Oblong UNDER Rectangle
AS(
    width DOUBLE DEFAULT 1,
    length DOUBLE DEFAULT 2
)
INSTANTIABLE
NOT FINAL;
</code></pre>

Attributes can have default values, but not constraints (meaning you
can't even declare an attribute as NOT NULL).  It's not even possible
to use domains to work around this, since domains can only be based on
builtin types.  However, it is possible to use column-level
constraints or validation code in a constructor instead.

<pre><code>

CREATE TABLE PolkaDots(
    dot_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Circle dot NOT NULL CHECK ((dot.radius > 0) IS TRUE),
    center_x DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    center_y DOUBLE NOT NULL);
</code></pre>

Note that the NOT NULL constraint on dot applies to the Circle object
as a whole (not to its radius attribute, which is validated by the
CHECK clause).  Attempting to reference an attribute of a null type
instance results in NULL (not an exception as you might expect).

<li>Finally, an entire <em>Java class</em> can be used as the
implementation of a user-defined type, as specified in SQL/JRT, also
known as SQLJ Part 2.  Java user-defined types differ significantly
from non-Java structured types, so they aren't currently covered by
this document.

</ul>


<h2>Typed Tables</h2>

SQL99 allows structured types to be used in two different modes:

<ul>

<li>In the same fashion as a builtin type.  For example, one might
replace the three columns first_name/middle_name/last_name in a table
with a single column of structured type full_name, and similarly for
the parameters of user-defined routines which operate on names.

<li>As the underlying definition of a <em>typed table</em>.  A typed
table is similar to the concept of an <em>extent</em> in an
object-oriented database; it provides <em>persistence</em> and
<em>object identity</em> for values of a user-defined type, and
automatically maps the attributes of the structured-type onto the
columns of the typed table.  It also maps type inheritance onto extent
inheritance (allowing, for example, a query against a shape table to
implicitly union all circles with rectangles).

</ul>

This document does not cover typed tables any further, nor does it
cover locators and references; instead, the focus is on the semantics
of structured types and their instances.


<h2>Routines</h2>

SQL behavior can be extended by defining various kinds of
<em>SQL-invoked routines</em>.  SQL-invoked routines may be
implemented in the SQL standard stored procedure language, SQL/PSM (in
which case they are called <em>SQL routines</em>), or in another
language such as Java (in which case they are called <em>external
routines</em>, defined in SQL/OLB, also known as SQLJ Part 1).  The
choice of implementation language is orthogonal to the contexts in
which routines may be invoked, as listed here:

<ul>

<li><em>Procedures</em> are routines invoked explicitly via the SQL
<code>CALL</code> statement.  Procedures are not associated with a
particular type, and cannot be used in SQL row expressions.  An SQL-invoked
procedure is similar to a C++ free function with void return type.

<pre><code>
CREATE PROCEDURE raise_annual_salary(IN raise_percentage DOUBLE)
LANGUAGE SQL
MODIFIES SQL DATA
BEGIN
    UPDATE emps SET salary = salary + salary*raise_percentage;
END;

CALL raise_annual_salary(0.10);

</code></pre>

<li><em>Functions</em> are routines which are invoked from SQL row
expressions.  Functions are not associated with a particular type.  An
SQL-invoked function is similar to a C++ free function with non-void return
type.

<pre><code>
CREATE FUNCTION sqr(x DOUBLE) 
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE SQL
CONTAINS SQL
RETURN(x*x);

SELECT sum(3.1415927*sqr(d.dot.radius)) as total_area FROM PolkaDots d;

</code></pre>

<li><em>Methods</em> are routines which invoked from SQL row
expressions and which are associated with a particular type.  An
SQL-invoked method is similar to a method in C++ or Java, and may be
either static (type-level) or non-static (instance-level).  Methods
are declared as part of the type definition, but defined separately.
Methods are normally invoked with a parenthesized argument list, but
for niladic methods the parentheses can be dropped:

<pre><code>
CREATE TYPE Shape2D
NOT INSTANTIABLE
NOT FINAL
INSTANCE METHOD area() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL;

CREATE TYPE Circle UNDER Shape2D
AS(
    radius DOUBLE DEFAULT 1
)
INSTANTIABLE
FINAL
OVERRIDING INSTANCE METHOD area() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL;

CREATE TYPE Rectangle UNDER Shape2D
NOT INSTANTIABLE
NOT FINAL
OVERRIDING INSTANCE METHOD area() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL
INSTANCE METHOD rect_width() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL
INSTANCE METHOD rect_length() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL;

CREATE TYPE Square UNDER Rectangle
AS(
    side_length DOUBLE DEFAULT 1
)
INSTANTIABLE
FINAL
OVERRIDING INSTANCE METHOD rect_width() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL;
OVERRIDING INSTANCE METHOD rect_length() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL;

CREATE TYPE Oblong UNDER Rectangle
AS(
    width DOUBLE DEFAULT 1,
    length DOUBLE DEFAULT 2
)
INSTANTIABLE
NOT FINAL
OVERRIDING INSTANCE METHOD rect_width() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL
OVERRIDING INSTANCE METHOD rect_length() RETURNS DOUBLE CONTAINS SQL;

CREATE INSTANCE METHOD area()
RETURNS DOUBLE
FOR Circle
RETURN 3.1415927*sqr(radius);

CREATE INSTANCE METHOD area()
RETURNS DOUBLE
FOR Rectangle
RETURN rect_width*rect_length;

CREATE INSTANCE METHOD rect_width()
RETURNS DOUBLE
FOR Oblong
RETURN width;

CREATE INSTANCE METHOD rect_length()
RETURNS DOUBLE
FOR Oblong
RETURN length;

CREATE INSTANCE METHOD rect_width()
RETURNS DOUBLE
FOR Square
RETURN side_length;

CREATE INSTANCE METHOD rect_length()
RETURNS DOUBLE
FOR Square
RETURN side_length;

SELECT d.dot.area FROM PolkaDots d;

SELECT d.dot.area() FROM PolkaDots d;
</code></pre>

<li><em>Constructor functions</em> are special niladic functions which
create new instances of types.  By default, the system defines a
constructor function for each type which sets all attributes to the
default value; this definition cannot be overridden.  Constructor
functions may not be invoked except via the NEW expression:

<pre><code>
INSERT INTO PolkaDots VALUES(1,NEW CIRCLE(),0,0);
</code></pre>

<li><em>Constructor methods</em> are special methods which initialize
a new instance of a type.  Constructor methods are also invoked via
the <code>NEW</code> expression, which (when given arguments) combines
the system-defined constructor function with the appropriate
user-defined constructor method:

<pre><code>
CREATE TYPE Circle UNDER Shape2D
AS(
    radius DOUBLE DEFAULT 1
)
INSTANTIABLE
FINAL
CONSTRUCTOR METHOD Circle(radius DOUBLE) RETURNS Circle 
SELF AS RESULT
CONTAINS SQL;

CREATE CONSTRUCTOR METHOD Circle(radius DOUBLE)
FOR Circle
RETURNS Circle
BEGIN
    SET SELF.radius = radius;
    RETURN SELF;
END;

INSERT INTO PolkaDots VALUES(2,NEW CIRCLE(20.5),10,100);
</code></pre>

(Note that the SQL <code>SELF</code> keyword serves the same purpose
as the <code>this</code> keyword in Java.)

<li><em>Observers</em> are special niladic methods which read an
attribute of a type (where the name of the attribute is the same as
the name of the observer method).  The system defines observers for
all attributes automatically, and they cannot be overridden.

<pre><code>
SELECT d.dot.radius() FROM PolkaDots d;

SELECT d.dot.radius FROM PolkaDots d;
</code></pre>

<li><em>Mutators</em> are special monadic methods which instantiate a
copy of an existing structured type instance and modify one of the
copy's attributes (where the name of the attribute is the same as the
name of the mutator method).  As for observers, the system defines
mutators for all attributes automatically, and they cannot be
overridden.  Mutator semantics are certainly confusing.  The example
below returns a result set of Circle objects equivalent to the dots in
the PolkaDots table with doubled radii.  Despite appearances, it
does not directly return the radii themselves:

<pre><code>
SELECT d.dot.radius(d.dot.radius*2) FROM PolkaDots d;
</code></pre>

Traditional attribute lvalue semantics are also supported for updates:

<pre><code>
UPDATE PolkaDots SET dot.radius = dot.radius*2;
</code></pre>

This is equivalent to:

<pre><code>
UPDATE PolkaDots SET dot = dot.radius(dot.radius*2);
</code></pre>

</ul>


<h2>Routine Modifiers</h2>

A number of modifiers can be applied to routines when they are defined:

<ul>

<li><code>LANGUAGE</code>: this specifies the implementation language.
The examples above all used <code>SQL</code>, but later we'll see some
examples which specify <code>JAVA</code> instead.

<li><code>PARAMETER STYLE</code>: this can be one of <code>{SQL |
GENERAL | JAVA}</code> and controls how routine parameter lists are
mapped into other languages for external routines.

<li><code>SPECIFIC <em>name</em></code>: an additional name by which
an overloaded routine is known in the catalog.  This allows a routine
to be referenced by specific name without having to include its full
signature.

<li><code>[NOT] DETERMINISTIC</code>: specifies whether the routine
always produces the same result given the same inputs and persistent state.

<li><code>{NO SQL | CONTAINS SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA
}</code>: constraints the usage of SQL within the implementation of
the routine.

<li><code>DYNAMIC RESULT SETS</code>: for procedures, whether result
sets are returned when the procedure is invoked.  Procedural result
sets are not covered in this document.

<li><code>[ RETURNS NULL | CALLED ] ON NULL INPUT</code>: for functions,
whether the routine is actually called if one of its arguments is
NULL.  <code>RETURNS NULL</code> forces the executor to short-circuit
the function invocation, supplying NULL for its result.

</ul>


<h2>Routine Parameters</h2>

Most routine parameters are input-only.  However, procedures allow
parameters to be specified as one of <code>{ IN | OUT | INOUT
}</code>.  Parameter names are optional (but still recommended) when
an external routine is specified, since external routine lookup is by
type signature.  Parameters do not take default values.


<h2>Casting Around a Type Hierarchy</h2>

The equivalent of the Java <code>instanceof</code> keyword is the
<code>IS [NOT] OF</code> syntax:

<pre><code>
SELECT p.name
FROM ParkingLots p
WHERE p.geometry IS OF (Square,Circle);
</code></pre>

Casting is sometimes required to get the right version of a method due
to overloading or overriding.  The normal SQL <code>CAST</code>
keyword is not used for this purpose.  Instead, the syntax for
downcasting uses the <code>TREAT</code> keyword:

<pre><code>
SELECT TREAT(p.geometry AS Square).side_length
FROM ParkingLots p
WHERE p.geometry IS OF (Square);
</code></pre>

For upcasting, the TREAT keyword is omitted:

<pre><code>
SELECT generate_label(d.dot AS Shape)
FROM PolkaDots p;
</code></pre>

If the <code>generate_label</code> function were overloaded with
different versions for Circles and for generic Shapes, then the query
above will invoke the generic Shape version.  For the gory details on
routine resolution, consult the standard.

<p>

Besides explicit type hierarchy casting, SQL99 also provides for

<ul>

<li>User-defined casts via the <code>CREATE CAST</code> statement.
These are relevant for structured types; for distinct types, cast
functions to and from builtin types can be referenced as part of the
type definition.

<li>User-defined comparisons via the <code>CREATE ORDERING</code>
statement.

<li>User-defined transformation to and from representations which can
be used in non-SQL programming languages. These are defined via the
<code>CREATE TRANSFORM</code> statement, which is unnecessary for
Java; JDBC already defines the <a href="">SQLData interface</a> for
this purpose.

<li>Implicit casting on the return value of functions via the
<code>CAST FROM</code> clause (mostly useful with external routines
where the routine wasn't defined with SQL in mind).

<li>Type-preserving functions via the <code>RESULT</code> clause; I
haven't decoded this part of the standard yet.

</ul>


<h2>Bookkeeping</h2>

After a type has been defined, it can be maintained with the
<code>ALTER TYPE</code> statement, which allows for 

<ul>

<li>add attribute

<li>add method

<li>drop attribute

<li>drop method

</ul>

Types can be dropped, but only with <code>RESTRICT</code> semantics
(no <code>CASCADE</code>).

<p>

Procedures, functions, and types may be defined in any schema, but
methods must be defined in the same schema as the associated type.

<p>

SQL99 introduces the notion of a <em>SQL-path</em>, which is used to
resolve unqualified references to procedures, functions, and types
(similar to the way the <code>PATH</code> environment variable is used
to resolve executable names).  Each schema has a SQL-path associated
with it; objects defined within that schema use that path implicitly.
Sessions also have their own SQL-paths used for dynamic SQL.  

<p>

As with table references in views, unqualified routine references are
"frozen" at the time the invoking code is validated so that subsequent
path changes do not affect them.  However, the situation is a little
more complicated in the case of late binding; instead of freezing on a
single routine, the system freezes a candidate set with final matching
performed at execution time.  In the examples above, an invocation of
<code>shape.area()</code> does not know until execution whether a
particular shape is a Rectangle or a Circle.


<h2>External Routines</h2>

So far all of the examples have defined SQL routines (using SQL/PSM
for the procedure implementation language).  For Farrago, we are also
interested in using Java as a routine implementation language.
SQL/OLB provides this, including the capability to embed SQL in Java.
However, it does NOT allow methods to be defined in Java for normal
structured types, only procedures and functions.  In order to define
methods in Java, you have to go all the way and use Java structured
types (SQL/JRT, not covered here).

<p>

Defining a routine with a Java implementation is a multi-step process:

<ol>

<li>Write the routine and compile it as a Java class (possibly using a SQLJ
precompiler to translate any embedded SQL statements).

<pre><code>
class MathFuncs {
    public static double sqr(double d)
    {
        return d*d;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<li>Package the compiled Java class into a JAR file.

<li>From SQL, <code>CALL</code> the system-defined
<code>SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR</code> routine to install the JAR into the
DBMS.

<pre><code>
CALL SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR('file:/home/jvs/MathFuncs.jar','MathFuncsJavaLib');
</code></pre>

<li>Issue a <code>CREATE {FUNCTION|PROCEDURE}</code> statement
referencing the routine's Java implementation in the installed JAR.

<pre><code>
CREATE FUNCTION sqr(d DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
NO SQL
EXTERNAL NAME 'MathFuncsLib:MathFuncs.sqr'
LANGUAGE JAVA
PARAMETER STYLE JAVA;
</code></pre>

</ol>

Unfortunately, there's no way to combine all of this into a single DDL
statement with the routine body inline.  We may want to consider an
extension for this, e.g.

<pre><code>
CREATE FUNCTION sqr(d DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
NO SQL
INLINE
LANGUAGE JAVA
PARAMETER STYLE JAVA
    {
        return d*d;
    }
;
</code></pre>

The schema named <code>SQLJ</code> is a special schema maintained by
the system (just like <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code>).  It contains
other procedures for JAR maintenance (<code>REPLACE_JAR, REMOVE_JAR,
 ALTER_JAVA_PATH</code>).  Besides Java classes, JAR files can also
contain deployment descriptors such as the DDL for creating the SQL
routines and granting access to them.  In a way this is the inverse
of the inline routine definition mentioned above: instead of defining
everything in SQL, define everything in the JAR, and then issue a
single <code>CALL</code> from SQL to deploy it.


<h2>Access Control</h2>

SQL99 types have no concept of access control such as the
<code>public/private/protected</code> of Java and C++.  However, the
standard (and more powerful) GRANT/REVOKE mechanism can be used at the
method level instead.

<p>

When external routines execute SQL statements, the authorization with
which they run can be controlled via the <code>EXTERNAL
SECURITY</code> clause on the routine definition:

<ul>

<li><code>EXTERNAL SECURITY DEFINER</code>: the routine executes with
the privileges of the user who created the routine.

<li><code>EXTERNAL SECURITY INVOKER</code>: the routine executes with
the privileges of the user who invoked the routine.

<li><code>EXTERNAL SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED</code>: the system
decides (may be any user at all!).

</ul>

SQL routines always run with INVOKER privileges.


<h2>User Defined Aggregates</h2>

SQL99 does not provide a mechanism for user-defined aggregates.  See
