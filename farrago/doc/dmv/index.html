<h1>Farrago DMV</h1>

This document provides an overview of Farrago's Dependency/Dataflow
Metadata Visualization (DMV) support.  The DMV framework makes it
possible to build advanced visualization interfaces for any repository
metadata stored or accessible by Farrago.  This page walks through
an example using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz</a> to
render dataflow views into a set of related table/view schemas.

<p>

The reader is encouraged to browse through all the diagrams first to
get a sense for what DMV is good for, and then make a second pass to
study the mechanisms used to create them.

<p>

DMV is based on the <a href="../lurql.html">LURQL</a> metadata query
language, so that link is required reading for understanding the
details; it also covers the <a href="../fem/index.html">FEM</a>
metadata model used in the examples here.

<h2>Example Metadata</h2>

The example visualization input is defined by the DDL script below
(part of <code>farrago/examples/dmv/test.sql</code>), with the domain
being, um, a travel agency.  The table and view definitions are only
intended to simulate meaningful dependencies at table-level and
schema-level; the actual details of the definitions are bogus.

<pre><code>
create schema accounts;

create table accounts.customers(customer_id int not null primary key);

create table accounts.addresses(address_id int not null primary key);

create view accounts.customer_addresses 
as select * from accounts.customers, accounts.addresses;

create schema car_rentals;

create table car_rentals.cars(car_id int not null primary key);

create table car_rentals.contracts(contract_id int not null primary key);

create view car_rentals.customer_rentals as
select * from accounts.customers, car_rentals.contracts, car_rentals.cars;

create schema lodging;

create table lodging.hotels(hotel_id int not null primary key);

create table lodging.cabins(cabin_id int not null primary key);

create view lodging.locations as
select * from lodging.hotels
union all
select * from lodging.cabins;

create view lodging.registrations as
select * from accounts.customers, lodging.locations;

create schema billing;

create view billing.events as
select * from car_rentals.customer_rentals, lodging.registrations;

create view billing.all_addresses as
select * from accounts.addresses, lodging.locations;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Executing a Visualization</h2>

Once the example input has been defined, a few more setup steps are required
in order to start executing visualizations:

<pre><code>
create schema dmv_test;

create procedure dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    foreign_server_name varchar(128),
    lurql_filename varchar(1024),
    transformation_filename varchar(1024),
    dot_filename varchar(1024))
language java
no sql
external name 'class net.sf.farrago.test.DmvTestUdr.renderGraphviz';
</code></pre>

The DDL above registers the Graphviz transformation procedure, making
it callable from SQL.  The procedure takes four input parameters:

<ul>

<li><i>foreign_server_name</i>:  location of metadata to be queried; in
this doc, we'll always pass null here to indicate that we want to
query the metadata in Farrago's own catalog (in particular, the
schema definitions we created above)

<li><i>lurql_filename</i>:  path to a file containing a LURQL query which
selects the objects to be visualized

<li><i>transformation_filename</i>: path to a file containing an XML
specification of how to transform the LURQL query results into a
dependency graph; the details of this file will be covered below (see
<a href=
"http://farrago.sf.net/api/org/eigenbase/jmi/JmiDependencyMappedTransform.html">
JmiDependencyMappedTransform</a> for the underlying
implementation)

<li><i>dot_filename</i>:  path to the .dot file to be created as a result
of executing the procedure

</ul>

Here's our first invocation:

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/schemaDependencies.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/schemaDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/schemaDependencies.dot');
</code></pre>

Before looking at the input files, view the resulting .dot file using
Graphviz to see what came out.  On Linux, use the following command
after first installing GraphViz:

<pre><code>
cd farrago/examples/dmv/results
dot -Tpng schemaDependencies.dot > schemaDependencies.png
</code></pre>

Then open the .png file in a web browser.  (Or if you have ImageMagick
installed, use a command like <code>dot -Tpng schemaDependencies.dot |
display</code> to view the .dot file directly.)  You should see this:

<br>
<img src="schemaDependencies.png">
<br>

What you have just created is a dataflow diagram which rolls up the
individual view/table dependencies to the schema level.  How does that
work?  First, here's the query from <code>schemaDependencies.lurql</code>:

<pre><code>
select *
from class LocalSchema
where name in ('ACCOUNTS', 'CAR_RENTALS', 'LODGING', 'BILLING') then (
    follow composite forward destination class ColumnSet then (
        follow origin end client
    )
);
</code></pre>

This query starts with the schemas of interest, collects the tables
and views contained by those schemas, and also retrieves dependencies
of which those objects are clients.  However, it does not explicitly
retrieve the suppliers of those dependencies.  The reason is that we
only want to visualize the dependencies between the schemas of
interest (instead of dragging in other schemas such as system schemas).

<p>

The result of that query is then transformed into a dependency graph
using the rules in <code>schemaDependencies.xml</code>:

<pre><code>
&lt;DmvTransformationRuleSet&gt;
  &lt;SetAllByAggregation 
    requestedKind="composite" 
    mapping="CONTRACTION"/&gt;
  &lt;SetAllByAggregation 
    requestedKind="none" 
    mapping="COPY"/&gt;
  &lt;SetByAssoc
    assoc="DependencyClient"
    mapping="CONTRACTION"/&gt;
&lt;/DmvTransformationRuleSet&gt;
</code></pre>

Here's the interpretation:

<ul>

<li>The first rule says that all composite associations in the UML
model are to be transformed via graph <code>CONTRACTION</code>.  For
example, the two views EVENTS and ALL_ADDRESSES are both composite
children of the BILLING schema, so the corresponding vertices are all
rolled together into one vertex, with the outermost composite (schema
BILLING) serving as the representative for all of them.

<li>The second rule says that all non-composite associations in the
UML model are to be preserved (<code>COPY</code>) as edges in the
dependency graph.  This includes the client and supplier associations
of CwmDependency, which is what gives the resulting diagram the
desired connectivity (after rolling them up to the schema level).

<li>Finally, the last rule says that the specific association named
<code>DependencyClient</code> is to be treated as a
<code>CONTRACTION</code> rather than a <code>COPY</code>.  This is
actually superfluous because in FEM, each <code>Dependency</code>
object already has a composite association with the client
(<code>ElementOwnership</code>) in addition to the non-composite
<code>ClientDependency</code>.  But it illustrates how to override
the settings for a particular association, and it is necessary
for subsequent examples to work correctly when the mapping for
composite associations is changed.

</ul>

Note that the dependency graph data structure is set up to discard
self-loops, otherwise every schema vertex would have one to represent
its internal dependencies.

<hr>

Now let's drill down to the object level, but keeping the schemas 
as grouping constructs in the diagram for context:

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/schemaDependencies.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/objectDependenciesGrouped.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="objectDependenciesGrouped.png">
<br>

To get this diagram, the same query was used; only the transformation
rules changed.  <code>objectDependencies.xml</code> is almost the same
as <code>schemaDependencies.xml</code>, except that the mapping for
composite associations has been changed to <code>HIERARCHY</code>
instead of <code>CONTRACTION</code>.  This means that rather than
rolling up the dependencies, the composite container is converted into a 
grouping construct in the dependency graph.

<hr>

Graphviz didn't do such a great job with the layout in the previous
example due to the schema grouping.  What if we don't care about the
schemas at all, and only want to see the individual objects?

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/objectDependencies.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="objectDependencies.png">
<br>

For the visualization above, we left the transformation rules the same
as in the previous example, but changed the query:

<pre><code>
select o, d
from class LocalSchema
where name in ('ACCOUNTS', 'CAR_RENTALS', 'LODGING', 'BILLING') then (
    follow composite forward destination class ColumnSet as o then (
        follow origin end client as d
    )
);
</code></pre>

The only difference is that this one omits the schemas from the results
(so the HIERARCHY mapping is ignored as irrelevant).

<hr>

It's also possible to treat the same model association differently
depending on the actual object types to which it applies.  The next
visualization shows the tables grouped by schema, with the views
"floating" (as if they had no schema):

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/schemaDependencies.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/viewsFloating.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/viewsFloating.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="viewsFloating.png">
<br>

This was accomplished in <code>viewsFloating.xml</code> by adding an
additional rule to <code>objectDependencies.xml</code>:

<pre><code>
&lt;DmvTransformationRuleSet&gt;
  &lt;SetAllByAggregation 
    requestedKind="composite" 
    mapping="HIERARCHY"/&gt;
  &lt;SetAllByAggregation 
    requestedKind="none" 
    mapping="COPY"/&gt;
  &lt;SetByAssoc
    assoc="DependencyClient"
    mapping="CONTRACTION"/&gt;
  &lt;SetByAssoc
    assoc="ElementOwnership"
    targetClass="LocalView"
    mapping="REMOVAL"/&gt;
&lt;/DmvTransformationRuleSet&gt;
</code></pre>

The last rule says that when the child of an
<code>ElementOwnership</code> association is a <code>LocalView</code>,
delete the corresponding edge entirely (<code>REMOVAL</code>).  One
side-effect is that the parent schema BILLING is left in the diagram
as a dangling vertex (upper right).  Either DMV could be enhanced to
express the corresponding vertex removal, or else this situation
has to be handled via post-processing.

<hr>

Here's a visualization for a single schema by itself:

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/carRentalsOnly.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/carRentalsOnly.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="carRentalsOnly.png">
<br>

<hr>

Now, suppose we want to see the immediate periphery of this schema
(objects in other schemas which either reference or are referenced by
objects in schema CAR_RENTALS):

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/carRentalsPlusPeriphery.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/carRentalsPlusPeriphery.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="carRentalsPlusPeriphery.png">
<br>

Here's the LURQL which does this:

<pre><code>
select *
from class LocalSchema
where name = 'CAR_RENTALS' then (
    follow composite forward destination class ColumnSet then (
        follow origin end client then (
            follow destination end supplier destination class ColumnSet
        )
        union
        follow origin end supplier then (
            follow destination end client destination class ColumnSet
        )
    ) gather with parent then (
        follow composite backward destination class LocalSchema
    )
);
</code></pre>

<hr>

It's also possible to flip the direction of the dependency edges:

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/carRentalsOnly.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependenciesReversed.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/carRentalsReversed.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="carRentalsReversed.png">
<br>

The flip is accomplished by adding the following transformation rule:

<pre><code>
  &lt;SetByAssoc
    assoc="DependencySupplier"
    mapping="REVERSAL"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

LURQL is also good for recursively traversing object-level dependencies.
Here's a diagram of all objects downstream of the CUSTOMERS table:

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/customersDownstream.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/customersDownstream.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="customersDownstream.png">
<br>

And the LURQL:

<pre><code>
select *
from class ColumnSet where name='CUSTOMERS' then (
    recursively (
        follow origin end supplier then (
            follow destination end client destination class ColumnSet
        )
    ) then (
        follow composite backward destination class LocalSchema
    )
);
</code></pre>

<hr>

All objects upstream of the EVENTS view:

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/eventsUpstream.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/eventsUpstream.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="eventsUpstream.png">
<br>

LURQL:

<pre><code>
select *
from class ColumnSet where name='EVENTS' then (
    recursively (
        follow origin end client then (
            follow destination end supplier destination class ColumnSet
        )
    )
) gather with parent then (
    follow composite backward destination class LocalSchema
);
</code></pre>

<hr>

Finally, how about both directions at the same time?

<pre><code>
call dmv_test.dmv_render_graphviz(
    null, 
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/registrationsUpAndDownStream.lurql',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/objectDependencies.xml',
    '${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/dmv/results/registrationsUpAndDownStream.dot');
</code></pre>

<br>
<img src="registrationsUpAndDownStream.png">
<br>

LURQL:

<pre><code>
select *
from class ColumnSet where name='REGISTRATIONS' then (
    recursively (
        follow origin end supplier then (
            follow destination end client destination class ColumnSet
        )
    )
    union
    recursively (
        follow origin end client then (
            follow destination end supplier destination class ColumnSet
        )
    )
) gather with parent then (
    follow composite backward destination class LocalSchema
);
</code></pre>
