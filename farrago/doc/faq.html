<h1>Farrago Project FAQ</h1>

<h2>What's with the name?</h2> 

See the <a
href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=farrago">dictionary</a>.
But that's not the <a
href="http://www.quinion.com/words/topicalwords/tw-far1.htm">whole
story</a>.

<hr>

<h2>Does the world really need another open-source DBMS?</h2>

Perhaps surprisingly, yes.  Most of the offerings I've seen are fine
for running a website but inadequate for enterprise use.  In addition,
the most popular open-source systems are burdened with legacy code and
architecture.  There are many ways to go wrong, especially if the goal
is something as banal as a quick buck, mindshare, or a dumping ground
for an unsuccessful commercial product.  The basics of relational
database technology are mature, well-known, and non-proprietary;
despite its name, Farrago is all about taking the time to create a
maintainable, high-quality implementation that can eventually replace
even the most heavyweight closed-source products (OK, that and
achieving world peace).  Novelty is a non-goal.

<hr>

<h2>If novelty is a non-goal, why should I even be interested?  Why
not just use MySQL or PostgreSQL?  Or Oracle if I can afford it?</h2>

Farrago's hybrid Java/C++ architecture opens up a number of opportunities
not available to traditional DBMS implementations (or much more difficult):

<ul>

<li>
Tight integration with Java-based application servers.  For example,
rather than reinventing cluster management, a future clustered version
of Farrago could be managed through generic application server
facilities.  There are similar opportunities for features such as
distributed transactions, resource pooling, software update
distribution, hot upgrades, etc.

<li>
Better extensibility environment.  Writing a UDF in Java (with garbage
collection) means the UDF can run in-process without having to worry
about memory corruption and leaks affecting the server.

<li>
Seamless implementation for SQL standard Java stored procedures and
object-oriented user-defined types.

<li>
JIT compilation of SQL expression and procedure code.  Farrago is
already able to implement many SQL scalar expressions and some
relational expressions by generating Java code on the fly.  (The same
technique will be used for stored procedures).  This can be
automatically compiled further into native code by JIT.  This should
be a big win for commonly re-executed transactional statements as well
as long-running complex queries.

<li>
Less security risk.  Java is not perfect in this respect, but it
reduces the chance of common exploits such as buffer overruns in
non-performance-critical code.  And the C++ portions use modern memory
management techniques (string, vector, shared_ptr, etc), with STLport
bounds-checking turned on for all debug builds.

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Isn't Java slow?  Doesn't that mean Farrago can't possibly compete
with systems implemented entirely in C/C++?</h2>

Careful attention has been paid to keep Java out of the most important
data processing paths.  Where Java is used (metadata management,
parsing, validation, and optimization, plus a targeted role in
executing generated code), its performance is acceptable.

<h2>Under what license is Farrago distributed?</h2>

<em>Current status:</em> The Farrago/Fennel code has more than one
copyright owner.  Portions are licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</a>; the rest
is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html/">GNU

Sun Public License</a>.  MonRG (used for string resource management)

Common Public License</a>.

<p>

<em>Near future:</em> We are currently in the process of incorporating
a <a href="http://www.eigenbase.org">non-profit organization</a> whose
mission is to promote further development of Farrago and other
open-source DBMS projects.  The current copyright holders will assign
joint copyright to this non-profit, and all future contributors will
be asked to sign a joint copyright agreement as well.  In addition,
the license for all code will be <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> (with appropriate
special permissions for using MDR and the Java runtime libraries,
since the Sun licenses are GPL-incompatible in the absence of the
special permission).  Dual licensing will be available for
closed-source commercial use in exchange for significant contributions
to the project.

<h2>What version of the SQL standard does Farrago implement?</h2>

We are developing towards SQL99, with parts of SQL200n where relevant.

<hr>

<h2>Are you insane?  Why are you even attempting this?</h2>

<b>John Sichi's personal answer:</b>

Maybe.  Because.  Ok, at least three reasons:

<ul>

<li>The giants are out there.  They're not windmills.  Someone's got
to take them on.

<li>I have built significant portions of four different DBMS products
in my for-hire career.  Each time, I ended up having to walk away from
a lot of code, usually due to changes in company direction.  I need
closure.

<li>It seems that every few years someone gets an idea for a new DBMS
which is going to solve some niche problem, thus avoiding direct
competition with the big boys.  (I've been involved with a couple of
these.)  What happens is that 90% of the effort gets burnt on building
all the infrastructure required for a generic DBMS, and only 10% on
the proprietary solution.  This is counter-productive.  So, even if
Farrago never achieves its most ambitious goals, its architecture
should still make it a useful platform for this kind of effort.
</ul>

<h2>Why a jackalope for the mascot?</h2>

The wily jackalope combines the speed of a jackrabbit with the fluid
grace and complex headgear of an antelope, which seems appropriate for
a hybrid Java/C++ system.  In addition, the jackalope symbolizes a
vision beyond our mundane reality (and is also reputed to be
surprisingly savage when cornered).
