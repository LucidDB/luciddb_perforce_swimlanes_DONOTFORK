<h1>Farrago Extensibility</h1>

<hr>

One of the innovative aspects of the Farrago architecture is its
approach to extensibility.  Of course, features such as user-defined
types and routines are hardly novel, and <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7/static/extend.htm">earlier DBMS
projects</a> have taken extensibility quite far already by applying it
to features such as indexing and access methods.  In this document,
we'll explain how Farrago radically redefines what it means for a DBMS
platform to be extensible.  By way of illustration, here's a plain,
boring DBMS which hasn't been extended in any way:

<p>

<h2>The Gist</h2>

<em>Farrago provides system-level extensibility instead of just
feature-level extensibility</em>.

<p>

What does this mean?  A platform with feature-level extensibility
defines a fixed set of extensible features, and for each one defines
service-provider interfaces and mechanisms for plugging in custom
implementations.  Here's our friend again after his feet and one of
his eyes have been customized independently:

<p>

<img src="featureExtensibility.png">

<p>

Examples of extensible features in existing DBMS projects include

<ul>

<li>routines (stored procedures, user-defined functions, user-defined
aggregators)

<li>datatypes (OODB's, user-defined types, datablades, cartridges)

<li>table storage (e.g. <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/storage-engines.html">MySQL
storage engines</a>)

<li>indexes, access methods and associated optimizer parameters
(e.g. <a href="http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu">GiST</a>)

</ul>

But what if the platform doesn't have the feature you want in the
first place?  For example, important capabilities like sequences,
materialized views, triggers, XML, or federated queries may not be
available in your favorite DBMS yet.  Or perhaps you have invented
something new and equally powerful, and are trying to figure out how
to bolt it on.  

<p>

Without system-level extensibility, your options are limited:

<ol>

<li>If your platform of choice is open-source, fork it and patch in
your new feature.  Every time the platform is upgraded, you'll have to
merge the changes and deal with conflicts if you want to keep up with
it.  If your innovation is good, you may be able to get it accepted as
a contribution so that other developers will share the maintenance
burden, but impediments such as project politics or license conflicts
may prevent you.

<li>Attempt to shoehorn your feature in by abusing one or more of the
existing extension interfaces.  This may work for simple features, but the
result is unlikely to be very attractive to users.

<li>Drop the notion of reusing a generic DBMS platform altogether and
start building your own from scratch.  Don't laugh; it's been done too
many times already.

</ol>

Farrago aims to change all of that, and its architecture has been
planned out with this goal in mind, leading to exciting new
possibilities for every part of the system to be involved in
extensibility, and for entirely new features to be incorporated:

<p>

<img src="systemExtensibility.png">

<p>

How do we do it?  There are a few keys to the approach:

<ul>

<li>The architecture is model-driven wherever possible, and the model
is extensible.  As a result, extensions automatically propagate
throughout many parts of the system.  More on this later.

<li>All important system components (including the catalog, session
manager, parser, validator, optimizer, code generator, executor, and
storage manager) have corresponding extension interfaces and communicate
with each other primarily via these interfaces.

<li>Extension interfaces are defined coherently rather than in
isolation.  For example, you can choose to plug in a new catalog model
extension in isolation, and you can choose to plug in a new session
personality extension in isolation.  But you can also design your new
session personality to manipulate your catalog model extensions.
Likewise with optimizer rules, table storage, and access methods.

<li>Object-oriented and pattern-driven design principles guide the
placement of component boundaries.  For example, an optimizer rule is
defined independently of the kind of optimizer (heuristic, cost-based,
randomized) which utilizes it.  Usage of Java and C++ as the
implementation languages means the extensibility mechanisms have
natural representations (instead of cumbersome constructs such as
tables of function pointers in C).

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

Here are just a few examples of the variety of system-level extensions
the Farrago framework should be able to support:

<ul>

<li>SQL/XML

<li>analytical features such as materialized views,
efficient star schemas, and SQL/OLAP

<li>"personalities" for making a server emulate a particular
DBMS product or a particular standard conformance level

<li>federated data management

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Reality Check</h2>

The pitch above may sound like a lot of pie in the sky.  And in truth,
there are limitations on any extensible architecture.  Some of them
are due to blind spots; it's impossible to foresee every possible
direction in which the system might be stretched.  Others are due to
practical constraints; we may know that a component needs to be
involved in extensibility, but we haven't yet gotten the time to do it
right, or we haven't come up with enough use-cases to feel confident
that the extensibility design will be generic enough.  Still others
are simply out of scope; for example, you may be able to cobble
together a distributed system out of multiple nodes running Farrago,
and the loosely-coupled design may assist you in this, but the
architecture does not address distributed-system issues, so the
promise of extensibility isn't going to be very relevant.

<p>

So, even using Farrago as a platform, you may at times still be faced
with some of the unpleasant choices enumerated earlier in this
document.  However, you may be able to contribute extensibility
enhancements to the platform and use them to satisfy your requirement,
without the need for any ongoing patch/merge maintenance.  And because
of the system-level extensibility design goal, others are more likely
to assist you with such an enhancement (assuming you take a sufficiently
generic approach instead of just slipping in a special-case hack).

<p>

The success of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse
project</a>, an IDE "for anything and nothing in particular," provides
hope that it's possible to do something similar for data management
services.

<p>

In case it's not clear, taking advantage of system-level extensibility
requires skilled developers with an understanding of UML modeling and
server-side Java.  For end-users and less-sophisticated developers,
feature-level extensibility is more appropriate.

<hr>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

Extended functionality is added to Farrago by installing plugins,
which are packaged as jars (with accompanying shared libraries for
plugins which contain C++ components).  Plugins are typically
installed via DDL commands, and in most cases installation does not
require restart of the JVM running Farrago (exceptions are noted
below).  This list provides an overview of the currently supported
plugin categories:

<ul>

<li>Catalog model: these plugins contain extensions to the standard
catalog model, expressed as UML static structure models.  The standard
catalog model contains definitions for the usual SQL objects such as
schemas, tables, and views.  A model plugin can define novel objects;
the example provided later on in this document explains how to add the
definition for a stateful random-number generator (similar to a
sequence).  Once installed, these extended objects behave exactly like
standard objects; they can be contained by schemas, referenced from
queries, involved in dependencies, etc.  Besides UML, catalog model
plugins also implement extension interfaces for controlling object
behavior, e.g.  DDL validation rules.  Catalog model plugins are
installed via the <code>ALTER SYSTEM ADD CATALOG JAR</code> statement,
which requires a JVM restart.  The system supports multiple active
catalog model extensions.

<li>Session manager: these plugins define shared system state
(e.g. repository implementation) and the state associated with each
session.  They are not installed via a DDL command; instead, a
top-level container for Farrago selects one of these to initialize the
system.  (Theoretically, it's possible for multiple containers in the
same JVM to load different session managers simultaneously, but in
practice that is likely to lead to trouble unless those session
managers are designed to work together.)

<li>Session personality: these plugins define session behavior,
including parsing, validation, optimization, and execution.  Session
manager plugins supply a default personality plugin for new sessions,
but a new personality can be selected at any time with the <code>ALTER
SESSION IMPLEMENTATION</code> statement (session personality is typically
stateless for this reason).  There is currently no support for
automatically combining multiple session personalities within a single
session; however, each session can have its own personality.

<li>Foreign data wrappers: these plugins define standard <a
href="design/sqlmed.html">SQL/MED access</a> to data whose definition
and storage are managed externally.  Foreign data wrappers are
installed via the <code>CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER</code> statement.

<li>Local data wrappers: these plugins are similar to foreign data
wrappers, but extend additional interfaces which allow Farrago to
manage the definition and storage of new table types locally.  Local
data wrappers are installed via the <code>CREATE LOCAL DATA WRAPPER</code>
statement.

<li>User-defined routines and types: these plugins are 
<a href="design/UserDefinedTypesAndRoutines.html">
standard SQL stored procedures, user-defined functions, and
user-defined types</a> installed via the <code>CREATE
PROCEDURE/FUNCTION/TYPE</code> statements.

<li>Catalog repository storage: these plugins control 
<a href="howto/reposStorage.html">
how the catalog repository is stored</a>; typically just one of these
is installed as part of framework installation.

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Toy Example:  Random Number Generator</h2>

The rest of this document walks through a specific example in detail
to give a deeper sense of how system-level extensibility works.  The
source code for this example is available under
<code>dev/farrago/examples/rng</code>, and can be compiled and built
to test the extensibility mechanisms involved.  (If you have a Farrago
developer build, run <code>ant createPlugin</code> from that
directory.)  It also serves as a good clonable starting-point for
creating your own extension.

<p>

The premise is that we'd like to be able to add a random-number
generator object to the system.  It should be a first-class object
like a traditional sequence generator, and should have persistent
state to guarantee that the pseudo-random sequence won't repeat for as
long as possible.  Here's some sample SQL for how we want to be able
to define and use a random-number generator:

<pre><code>
-- define a new random number generator;
-- persist its state in a file named rng1.dat,
-- and give it an explicit seed so that the sequence is deterministic
create rng rng1 external 'rng1.dat' seed 999;

-- use a generated random number as a primary key for a new department;
-- generate the integer without any bound on the bits used to minimize
-- chance of a key collision
insert into depts(deptno,name)
values (next_random_int(unbounded from rng1), 'Lost and Found');

-- for each employee, generate a random number from 0 to 6 representing
-- the employee's day off
select name, next_random_int(ceiling 7 from rng1) as day_off
from emps;
<code></pre>

To accomplish this, we'll need a plugin which can serve as a catalog
model extension (to add the definition of a random-number generator)
and a session personality (to add the DDL support for
creating/dropping rng's, and to add the query support for referencing
them).

<p>

NOTE: this example plugin is not designed for production use; it does
not have proper concurrency control and transaction semantics, and its
file-system persistence mechanism is neither high performance nor
fault tolerant.  Instead, the implementation is intended to be kept
simple for instructional purposes.

<hr>

<h2>Example Continued:  Extending the Catalog Model</h2>

For this first step, it's necessary to use a UML modeling tool to create a
definition of the model extension and export it as XMI.  What's more,
we need a way to reference the standard catalog model so that we can
specify how the extension model relates to it.  Here's how it looks
in Poseidon:

<p>

<img src="rngModel.gif">

<p>

Our new UML class (<code>RandomNumberGenerator</code>) is a subclass
of the generic CWM class <code>ModelElement</code>.  Having
ModelElement as a superclass means that a RandomNumberGenerator has a
name, can be contained by a schema, and can have dependency
relationships with other objects.  We've defined two additional
attributes for it: <code>serializedFile</code> is the file-system
location where the persistent state is stored, and
<code>initialSeed</code> is the (optional) seed defined when the RNG
is created (if missing, the current time will be used).

<p>

For such a simple model extension, usage of UML may appear to be
overkill, and one could argue that a lighter-weight modeling
infrastructure such as XSD or POJO reflection would be more
appropriate.  However, most real system-level extensions are expected
to involve many classes with complex hierarchies and associations--a
domain in which UML is the best fit.  In addition, the rest of the
system is JMI-based, and we want model extensions to work exactly like
the rest of the model.

<p>

Once the extension model has been defined in UML, it can be translated
into JMI packages and corresponding XMI deployment descriptor.  To do
this, the build script invokes the <code>plugin.buildModel</code>
target inherited from the framework script
<code>dev/farrago/plugin/buildPlugin.xml</code>.  The 
<a href="api/net/sf/farrago/rngmodel/package-summary.html">
JMI interfaces</a> are generated under
<code>dev/farrago/examples/rng/catalog/java</code>.  The XMI
deployment descriptor is generated as
<code>dev/farrago/examples/rng/catalog/xmi/RngPluginModelExport.xmi</code>.

<hr>

<h2>Example Continued:  Defining Extended Model Behavior</h2>

Next, we need to add custom DDL handling.  This is the job of class <a
href="api/net/sf/farrago/rng/FarragoRngDdlHandler.html">
net.sf.farrago.rng.FarragoRngDdlHandler</a>.  It supplies a number of handler
routines:

<ul>

<li><code>validateDefinition</code>: during CREATE, expands the
location of the persistence file to an absolute path.

<li><code>executeCreation</code>: initializes a new random-number
generator (using class <code>java.util.Random</code> and the initial
seed, if specified) and persists its state

<li><code>executeDrop</code>: deletes the persistence file

</ul>

To tell Farrago what to do with our model plugin when it is
loaded, we need to implement
<a href="api/net/sf/farrago/session/FarragoSessionModelExtensionFactory.html">
extension interface
net.sf.farrago.session.FarragoSessionModelExtensionFactory</a>.  This
is done by
<a href="api/net/sf/farrago/rng/FarragoRngPluginFactory.html">
class net.sf.farrago.rng.FarragoRngPluginFactory</a>, which takes care
of returning DDL handlers when requested (and also other model aspects
such as localization, which is not covered here).

<p>

At this point, we have everything we need to build and install a model
plugin jar, and the installation would create new system tables
capable of storing metadata about RNG's.  However, doing so wouldn't
be very useful yet, because even though we've told the system what an
RNG is and how to react when someone wants to create one or drop one,
we haven't yet extended the DDL parser to actually support the custom
<code>CREATE/DROP</code> statements.  (Theoretically,
parser-generation could be model-driven as well, but most system-level
extensions require custom syntax.)  For that, we need a session
personality plugin.

<hr>

<h2>Example Continued:  Extending The DDL Parser</h2>

Like everything else in the framework, the Farrago parsers are defined
to be extended.  JavaCC doesn't support this out of the box, but we
have devised our own extensibility mechanisms on top of it.  In
particular, we use textual concatenation of the .jj grammar source
files, and we design those grammar files to be reusable.  Currently,
only one extension parser can be active in a session at a time (unlike
with models, we don't yet have a mechanism for combining multiple
extension parsers.)

<p>

Here's a snippet of the RNG example DDL parser
(<code>dev/farrago/examples/rng/src/net/sf/farrago/rng/RngParser.jj</code>):

<pre><code>
CwmModelElement ExtensionModelSchemaObjDefinition() :
{
    RngRandomNumberGenerator rng;
    SqlIdentifier qualifiedName;
    String externalLocation;
    long seed;
}
{
    &lt;RNG&gt;
        {
            rng = getRngModelPackage().getRngschema()
                .getRngRandomNumberGenerator().createRngRandomNumberGenerator();
        }
    qualifiedName = CompoundIdentifier3()
        {
            farragoParser.getDdlValidator().setSchemaObjectName(
                rng, qualifiedName);
        }
    &lt;EXTERNAL&gt; externalLocation = QuotedString()
        {
            rng.setSerializedFile(externalLocation);
        }
    [ &lt;SEED&gt; seed = UnsignedValue() { rng.setInitialSeed(new Long(seed)); } ]
    {
        return rng;
    }
}

CwmModelElement ExtensionModelDrop() :
{
    SqlIdentifier qualifiedName;
    RngRandomNumberGenerator rng;
}
{
    &lt;RNG&gt; qualifiedName = CompoundIdentifier3()
        {
            rng = (RngRandomNumberGenerator)
            farragoParser.getStmtValidator().findSchemaObject(
                qualifiedName,
                getRngModelPackage().getRngschema().
                getRngRandomNumberGenerator());
        }
    CascadeOption()
        {
            return rng;
        }
}

TOKEN :
{
  &lt; NEXT_RANDOM_INT: "NEXT_RANDOM_INT" &gt;
| &lt; RNG: "RNG" &gt;
| &lt; SEED: "SEED" &gt;
}
</code></pre>

The <code>ExtensionModelSchemaObjDefinition</code> and
<code>ExtensionModelDrop</code> grammar productions are defined as
no-ops in the standard parser; here we override them to accept our
custom RNG syntax and specify how to store the object definition in
the catalog (for later processing by
<code>FarragoRngDdlHandler</code>).  In addition, JavaCC allows us to
define new tokens as needed.

<p>

All that's left is to make sure that
<code>FarragoRngPluginFactory</code> implements
<a href="api/net/sf/farrago/session/FarragoSessionPersonalityFactory.html">
extension interface
net.sf.farrago.session.FarragoSessionPersonalityFactory</a> and
supplies Farrago with our customized parser instead of the default.

<hr>

<h2>Example Continued:  Testing the Plugin</h2>

At this point, we have everything we need to be able to instantiate
RNG's, but we still can't access them from queries.  For the impatient
reader, let's use a quick-and-dirty approach: we'll create a
user-defined function to do the job.  (Later, we'll explain how to
extend the query parser so that we don't need to rely on this UDF.)

<p>

Class 
<a href="api/net/sf/farrago/rng/FarragoRngUDR.html">
class net.sf.farrago.rng.FarragoRngUDR</a> contains static method
<code>rng_next_int</code> which can be used for this purpose.  It
takes the name of the RNG and the desired ceiling and produces an
integer.  It works by performing a catalog lookup to get the location
of the serialization file for the RNG, and then accesses that file to
instantiate the RNG, generate the next number, and then persist the
modified state.

<p>

The <code>ant createPlugin</code> task takes care of building the
plugin (<code>dev/farrago/examples/rng/plugin/FarragoRng.jar</code>).
Installing a model plugin performs some heavy-duty surgery on the
repository, and should only be performed from a single-user instance
of Farrago, so we'll use <code>sqllineEngine</code> for this purpose:

<pre><code>
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; set schema 'sys_boot.sys_boot';
No rows affected (4.869 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt;
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; create jar rngplugin
. . . . . . . . &gt; library 'file:${FARRAGO_HOME}/examples/rng/plugin/FarragoRng.jar'
. . . . . . . . &gt; options(0);
No rows affected (0.197 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt;
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; alter system add catalog jar rngplugin;
No rows affected (7.887 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; Closing: net.sf.farrago.jdbc.engine.FarragoJdbcEngineConnection

</code></pre>

(After the <code>ALTER SYSTEM ADD CATALOG JAR</code> statement
completes, the system is in an unusable state and must be shut down
immediately; the next restart will complete the installation process
as part of catalog boot.)

<p>

Now, let's give our newly installed plugin a whirl:

<pre><code>
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; create schema rngtest;
No rows affected (0.21 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; set schema 'rngtest';
No rows affected (2.223 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; set path 'rngtest';
No rows affected (0.022 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; alter session implementation set jar sys_boot.sys_boot.rngplugin;
No rows affected (0.049 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; create rng rng1 external '${FARRAGO_HOME}/testgen/rng1.dat' seed 999;
No rows affected (0.446 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; create function rng_next_int(
. . . . . . . . &gt;     rng_name varchar(512),
. . . . . . . . &gt;     n int)
. . . . . . . . &gt; returns int
. . . . . . . . &gt; language java
. . . . . . . . &gt; reads sql data
. . . . . . . . &gt; external name
. . . . . . . . &gt; 'sys_boot.sys_boot.rngplugin:net.sf.farrago.rng.FarragoRngUDR.rng_next_int';
No rows affected (0.444 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; select name,rng_next_int('rng1',7) as day_off
. . . . . . . . &gt; from sales.emps;
+--------+----------+
|  NAME  | DAY_OFF  |
+--------+----------+
| Fred   | 1        |
| Eric   | 6        |
| Wilma  | 5        |
| John   | 1        |
+--------+----------+
4 rows selected (0.081 seconds)
</code></pre>

Note that we had to explicitly activate the session personality via
<code>ALTER SESSION IMPLEMENTATION SET JAR</code>.  Normally, either a
system-level extension would include a session manager implementation
which does this automatically, or the correct default personality
would be associated with each user profile (this association is not
yet implemented).

<hr>

<h2>Example Continued:  Extending the Query Parser</h2>

The UDF above did the job, but it has a few drawbacks:

<ul>

<li>the syntax is cumbersome: the RNG name had to be quoted as a
string literal, and if we wanted an unbounded number to be generated,
we would have to pass a special value (-1 in this case) to indicate it

<li>the dependency between the query and the RNG is not recorded; this
means that if the UDF is used in a view definition, and the RNG is
later dropped, the system won't know that it is supposed to CASCADE
the drop to the view

<li>performance suffers because the UDF has to look up the RNG in the
catalog every time it is invoked (four times in the example query
above because it returns four rows)

</ul>

We can do better, but it involves digging into the Farrago query
processing system.  So if you've already had enough low-level
internals for your taste, you can stop reading now.  Otherwise, let's
take a look at the parser change for our custom query syntax:

<pre><code>
SqlNode ExtendedBuiltinFunctionCall() :
{
    SqlIdentifier id;
    long longCeiling;
    int ceiling = -1;
    RngRandomNumberGenerator rng;
}
{
    &lt;NEXT_RANDOM_INT&gt;
         &lt;LPAREN&gt;
         (
             &lt;CEILING&gt; longCeiling = UnsignedValue()
             {
                 ceiling = (int) longCeiling;
             }
             | &lt;UNBOUNDED&gt;
         )
         &lt;FROM&gt;
         id = CompoundIdentifier3()
         &lt;RPAREN&gt;
        {
            rng = (RngRandomNumberGenerator)
            farragoParser.getStmtValidator().findSchemaObject(
                id,
                getRngModelPackage().getRngschema().
                getRngRandomNumberGenerator());
            return
            FarragoRngOperatorTable.rngInstance().nextRandomInt.createCall(
                new SqlNode [] {
                    SqlLiteral.createExactNumeric(
                        Integer.toString(ceiling),
                        getPos()),
                    SqlLiteral.createCharString(
                        FarragoCatalogUtil.getQualifiedName(rng).toString(),
                        getPos()),
                    SqlLiteral.createCharString(
                        FarragoProperties.instance().expandProperties(
                            rng.getSerializedFile()),
                        getPos())
                }, 
                getPos());
        }
}
</code></pre>

<code>ExtendedBuiltinFunctionCall</code> is another parser extension
point.  Our custom production and accompanying Java code constructs
a SqlNode instance representing the <code>NEXT_RANDOM_INT</code> call.

<p>

But what is that reference to <code>FarragoRngOperatorTable</code>?  Our
plugin defines an extension to the standard table of SQL operators
provided by Farrago.  For each custom expression such as
<code>NEXT_RANDOM_INT</code>, we define a corresponding operator
(<code>FarragoRngNextRandomIntOperator</code> in this case) with
custom behavior for validating instances of the expression (and other
details, such as how to unparse expression instances back into SQL
text).  The validation code also calls back into Farrago to record the
dependency of the query on the RNG.

<p>

Besides validation, we also need to tell Farrago how to generate
executable code to implement the expression as part of a query plan.
This logic is encapsulated in <code>FarragoRngImplementorTable</code>,
which generates Java code for a call to an optimized version of the
UDF defined previously.  This optimized version
(<code>rng_next_int_internal</code>) takes the persistence file
location as a parameter so that it can skip the catalog lookup (which
instead is done only once during query validation).

<p>

Finally, <code>FarragoRngPluginFactory</code> takes care of making
sure that our custom validation and code generation behavior gets
supplied to Farrago by implementing the correct session personality
interfaces.  Putting it all together:

<pre><code>

</code></pre>

Note that the first drop attempt failed due to the dependency of
<code>EMP_DAYS_OFF</code> on <code>RNG1</code>.  The custom drop logic
in <code>FarragoRngDdlHandler</code> does not do anything special to
enforce the RESTRICT option; instead, the uncustomized DDL validator
knows how to enforce that automatically because dependencies are a
generic part of the catalog model, and our model extension is now part
of the catalog model.  Likewise, the statement <code>DROP SCHEMA
RNGTEST CASCADE</code> will know that it is supposed to drop the
contained object <code>RNG1</code>, automatically invoking its custom
RNG drop logic as well.

<h2>Example Completed:  Extending Metadata Views</h2>

Earlier, this document claimed that model-driven architecture meant
that extension models propagate through the system automatically.
We've already seen one example with DROP RESTRICT.  Now let's see what
it means in the context of metadata views.  When the model was
extended during plugin installation, internal system views were
auto-created for each UML class in the extension model (contained by
corresponding internal schemas for each UML package in the extension
model).  To expose these, all that's necessary is to create a virtual
SQL/MED catalog:

<pre><code>
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; create server sys_rng
. . . . . . . . &gt; foreign data wrapper sys_mdr
. . . . . . . . &gt; options(root_package_name 'RNGModel');
No rows affected (0.114 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt;
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; select * from sys_rng."RNGSchema"."RandomNumberGenerator";
+-------+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| name  | visibility  |      namespace      |          serializedFile           | initialSeed  |        mofId        |      mofClassName      |
+-------+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| RNG1  | vk_public   | j:0000000000001DE1  | ${FARRAGO_HOME}/testgen/rng1.dat  | 999          | j:0000000000001DE6  | RandomNumberGenerator  |
+-------+-------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
1 row selected (0.802 seconds)
</code></pre>

To get a view with information more meaningful to an end-user, we
can join to one of the internal views used to define standard JDBC metadata:

<pre><code>
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; create view rng_list as
. . . . . . . . &gt;     select
. . . . . . . . &gt;         s.object_catalog as rng_catalog,
. . . . . . . . &gt;         s.object_schema as rng_schema,
. . . . . . . . &gt;         r."name" as rng_name,
. . . . . . . . &gt;         r."serializedFile" as serialized_file,
. . . . . . . . &gt;         r."initialSeed" as initial_seed
. . . . . . . . &gt;     from
. . . . . . . . &gt;         sys_boot.jdbc_metadata.schemas_view_internal s
. . . . . . . . &gt;     inner join
. . . . . . . . &gt;         sys_rng."RNGSchema"."RandomNumberGenerator" r
. . . . . . . . &gt;     on
. . . . . . . . &gt;         s."mofId" = r."namespace"
. . . . . . . . &gt; ;
No rows affected (0.504 seconds)
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt;
0: jdbc:farrago:&gt; select * from rng_list;

A real system-level extension can include a script for adding such
cleaned views to the catalog as part of plugin installation (not yet
implemented: SQL/J jar deployment descriptors).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

If you've made it this far, you should now have a good notion of what's
possible with Farrago's system-level extensibility; perhaps you even
have an idea for developing your own extension.  If so, we'd love to
hear from you at the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=80183">farrago-developers
mailing list</a>.
