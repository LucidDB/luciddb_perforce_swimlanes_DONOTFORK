<h1>HOWTO:  Configure Farrago Repository Storage</h1>

The metadata in Farrago's system catalog is stored in an instance of
an <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org">MDR</a> repository.  MDR supports
a storage plugin system for extensibility; by default, Farrago uses a
JDBC connection to an in-process <a
href="http://hsqldb.org">HSQLDB</a> engine.

<p>

This document describes how to configure other kinds of repository
storage.  You might well ask why Farrago relies on external storage
for its metadata instead of providing the storage itself.  Indeed,
self-storage is the eventual goal, but at the moment Farrago still
lacks some of the necessary SQL support.  (Also, the bootstrapping
challenge is non-trivial.)  Even once self-storage is available,
external storage is still a useful capability in cases
such as those listed below.

<hr>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

When might you want to configure custom repository storage?

<ul>

<li>One case would be when you want to reduce the number of stored
databases requiring maintenance.  For example, you might be using
Farrago as a middleware server for heterogeneous <a
href="../design/sqlmed.html">SQL/MED</a> queries or <a
href="medmdr.html">metadata federation</a>.  In such a configuration,
a good idea is to tell Farrago to store its repository in one of your
existing DBMS servers so that you have one less server to back up.  Or
your organization may require that all metadata be stored on a particular
server.

<li>Another scenario is shared access to the MDR repository
from clients besides the Farrago server.  This allows live
catalog metadata to be browsed or queried from multiple MDR applications.
Some caution is required since concurrency conflicts could interfere
with the Farrago server.

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Storage Properties</h2>

The Farrago build script configures repository storage by reading the
file <code>dev/farrago/catalog/ReposStorage.properties</code>, which
is in Java properties file format.  If this file does not exist
when the build starts, a default version is copied from
<code>dev/farrago/catalog/templates/HsqldbRepos.properties</code>.  The 
<code>ReposStorage.properties</code> file is also used at runtime to access
the repository.  Let's take a look at the default:

<pre><code>
# /home/jvs/open/farrago/catalog/ReposStorage.properties
# Repository storage properties for hsqldb

# Class name of MDR storage plugin factory
org.netbeans.mdr.storagemodel.StorageFactoryClassName=\
org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.jdbcimpl.JdbcStorageFactory

# JDBC driver for hsqldb
MDRStorageProperty.org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.jdbcimpl.driverClassName=\
org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver

# URL for database storage
MDRStorageProperty.org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.jdbcimpl.url=\
jdbc:hsqldb:${FARRAGO_CATALOG_DIR}/FarragoCatalog

# user name
MDRStorageProperty.org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.jdbcimpl.userName=SA

# password
MDRStorageProperty.org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.jdbcimpl.password=

# schema name (used as a table prefix)
MDRStorageProperty.org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.jdbcimpl.schemaName=MDR
</code></pre>

What do these properties mean?

<ul>

<li>The <code>StorageFactoryClassName</code> property tells MDR what 
storage plugin to use.  Normally this will be JDBC, but MDR also
supports a Java BTree implementation (see the 
<code>BTreeRepos.properties</code> file in the templates directory).
The rest of the property names have a prefix which indicates that
they are specific to this plugin.

<li>The <code>driverClassName</code> property selects a JDBC driver (HSQLDB).

<li>The <code>url</code> tells HSQLDB where to store the repository in
the file system.  The embedded <code>${FARRAGO_CATALOG_DIR}</code> property
reference is expanded by the Farrago build and runtime systems
automatically.

<li>The <code>userName</code>, <code>password</code> and
<code>schemaName</code> properties provide additional control over
HSQLDB access.

</ul>

<h2>Build Configuration</h2>

Now, let's suppose you want to customize Farrago to store its catalog
in a PostgreSQL server.  Before starting, make sure that
you can access your PostgreSQL server via JDBC, and record
information such as the URL, username, and password.  Here is an example
using sqlline:

<pre><code>
jvs@jackalope:~/open/test$ java -cp \
/home/jvs/open/thirdparty/sqlline.jar:\
/home/jvs/open/thirdparty/jline.jar:\
/home/jvs/postgresql-7.4.6/src/interfaces/jdbc/jars/postgresql.jar \
sqlline.SqlLine \
-u jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test \
-d org.postgresql.Driver \
-n postgres \
--isolation=TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE
Connecting to jdbc:postgresql:test
Connected to: PostgreSQL (version 7.4.6)
Driver: PostgreSQL Native Driver (version PostgreSQL 7.4.6 JDBC3 with SSL (build 215))
Autocommit status: true

sqlline version 1.0.0-jvs-1 by Marc Prud'hommeaux
0: jdbc:postgresql:test&gt; select * from information_schema.schemata;
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+------------------------+
| catalog_name  |     schema_name     | schema_owner  | default_character_set_ |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+------------------------+
| test          | pg_toast            | postgres      |                        |
| test          | pg_temp_1           | postgres      |                        |
| test          | pg_catalog          | postgres      |                        |
| test          | public              | postgres      |                        |
| test          | information_schema  | postgres      |                        |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+------------------------+
5 rows selected (0.068 seconds)
</code></pre>

<p>

The next step is to check the <code>dev/farrago/catalog/templates</code>
directory for a suitable template.  Not surprisingly, there's already
one defined for PostgreSQL, and it just happens to match the connection
information above.  Copy it into the parent directory 
(<code>dev/farrago/catalog</code>) and rename it to 
<code>ReposStorage.properties</code>.  If a file with that name already exists 
because you previously built Farrago with the default HSQLDB storage, you
can overwrite it (it was copied verbatim from the templates directory by the
build).

<p>

Now, edit <code>ReposStorage.properties</code> to match your configuration.
At this point, it's a good idea to verify your settings.  The Farrago
build script provides an ant target named <code>verifyReposSqlStorage</code>
for just this purpose.  Let's try it now:

<pre><code>
jvs@jackalope:~/open/farrago$ ant verifyReposSqlStorage
Buildfile: build.xml

verifyReposSqlStorage:

BUILD FAILED
/home/jvs/open/farrago/build.xml:1411: Class Not Found: JDBC driver org.postgresql.Driver could not be loaded

Total time: 3 seconds
</code></pre>

Ooops!  We forgot to tell the system the location of the jar
containing the driver, and it's not one of the default thirdparty
components.  So how do we do this?  The Farrago build system supports
custom properties via an optional file 
<code>dev/farrago/customBuild.properties</code>.  And the specific
property we need to set is named <code>farrago.custom.classpath</code>.  So,
create that file now, with contents like:

<pre><code>
# /home/jvs/open/farrago/customBuild.properties

# Tell Farrago where to find the PostgreSQL JDBC driver
farrago.custom.classpath=\
/home/jvs/postgresql-7.4.6/src/interfaces/jdbc/jars/postgresql.jar
</code></pre>

Now try again:

<pre><code>
jvs@jackalope:~/open/farrago$ ant verifyReposSqlStorage
Buildfile: build.xml

checkReposStorage:

configureReposStorage:

verifyReposSqlStorage:
     [echo] Successfully connected to jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 3 seconds
</code></pre>

Passing this test does not guarantee a good configuration, because it
just connects without trying to execute any SQL statements.  However, it
can save time in eliminating basic connectivity problems.

<p>

Now, run the command <code>ant createCatalog</code>.  This should
rebuild the Farrago catalog, storing it in PostgreSQL as requested.
If you get a build error, it probably means you have a deeper
configuration problem; see the <a
href="#DebuggingCatalogCreation">debugging section below</a> for help.
Otherwise, you're good to go.  Runtime scripts such as
<code>farragoServer</code> should work automatically, because
<code>ant createCatalog</code> emits the customized classpath into
<code>dev/farrago/classpath.gen</code> for use by these scripts.

<p>

Let's take a look at what happened behind the scenes.  Returning
to sqlline:

<pre><code>
0: jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test&gt; select * from information_schema.schemata;
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+------------------------+

| test          | pg_temp_1           | postgres      |                        |
| test          | pg_catalog          | postgres      |                        |
| test          | public              | postgres      |                        |
| test          | information_schema  | postgres      |                        |
| test          | FarragoCatalog      | postgres      |                        |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+------------------------+
6 rows selected (0.013 seconds)
</code></pre>

Aha, there's our FarragoCatalog schema.  What's inside?

<pre><code>
0: jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test&gt; select * from information_schema.tables where table_schema='FarragoCatalog';
+----------------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------+---------+
| table_catalog  |  table_schema   |    table_name     | table_type  | self_re |
+----------------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------+---------+
| test           | FarragoCatalog  | MOFID_SEQ         | BASE TABLE  |         |

| test           | FarragoCatalog  | Contexts26        | BASE TABLE  |         |
| test           | FarragoCatalog  | ObjectsByClasses  | BASE TABLE  |         |

| test           | FarragoCatalog  | aibn_1057         | BASE TABLE  |         |
| test           | FarragoCatalog  | aicp_1057         | BASE TABLE  |         |
| test           | FarragoCatalog  | ae_1057_1086_1    | BASE TABLE  |         |
| test           | FarragoCatalog  | ae_1057_1086_2    | BASE TABLE  |         |
| test           | FarragoCatalog  | ae_1057_1087_1    | BASE TABLE  |         |
| test           | FarragoCatalog  | ae_1057_1087_2    | BASE TABLE  |         |
...
</code></pre>

Blech.  If you were hoping to be able to query this schema directly for
metadata, forget about it.  The MDR model-to-table mapping is very low level
as you'll find out if you try querying some of those tables.  For
SQL access to metadata, use Farrago.

Debugging Catalog Creation

When catalog creation fails, MDR usually suppresses the real error
information and gives back a generic unhelpful message such as "Failed
accessing storage factory."  To dig out the real error message,
add the following line to your <code>ReposStorage.properties</code> file:

<pre><code>
MDRStorageProperty.org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.jdbcimpl.debugPrint=true
</code></pre>

Then retry the failed catalog creation.  Buried in the output should
be some useful details, e.g.

<pre><code>
...

</code></pre>

Once you have fixed the problem, delete the debug setting to avoid spurious
printing on standard error at runtime.

<hr>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

As a developer convenience, the Farrago build system provides the ant
targets <code>backupCatalog</code> and <code>restoreCatalog</code> to
perform offline backup of the catalog and database.  However, it only
works on files stored in the <code>dev/farrago/catalog</code>
directory, which is where the btree and HSQLDB files are stored.  So
if your repository is stored off in another database, these commands won't
work.  Instead, you need to use the backup/restore facilities of your
DBMS.

<p>

If you try to re-run <code>ant createCatalog</code> again after a
successful installation, you will probably get an error such as
"Package extent named 'FarragoMetamodel' already exists".  Normally,
<code>ant createCatalog</code> avoids this by blowing away the repository
storage in the catalog directory first, but since the repository is
now stored elsewhere, this doesn't work.  You have to do it manually:

<pre><code>
0: jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test&gt; drop schema "FarragoCatalog" cascade;
1 row affected (1.221 seconds)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

So far, this document has assumed the context of a Farrago developer
build.  How does all of this get packaged up and delivered to an end
user?  At the moment, there's no easy path.  A manual process would be
to perform a database export from the external server after a complete
build and packaging the export file together with
<code>ReposStorage.properties</code>.  Then an installation program
would import the repository database and tweak
<code>ReposStorage.properties</code> with site-specifics.

<p>

What's missing is a way to recapitulate the build process as part of
Farrago installation, so that nothing storage-specific needs to be
prepackaged.  This should be fairly trivial, since the ant tasks used
by the build are just thin wrappers around MDR API calls.  This should
be taken into consideration when developing the currently non-existent
Farrago installer.
