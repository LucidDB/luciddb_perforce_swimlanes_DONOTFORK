/**
 * <code>Infinite</code> is an empty interface which informs the optimizer
 * that an {@link java.util.Iterator} will -- or may -- never end. You can
 * then safely write code like
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>class MultiplesOf implements Iterator {
 *     int i, n;
 *     MultiplesOf(int n) {
 *         this.n = n;
 *         this.i = 0;
 *     }
 *     public boolean hasNext() {
 *         return true;
 *     }
 *     public Object next() {
 *         return i += n;
 *     }
 *     public void remove() {
 *         throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
 *     }
 * };
 * Iterator tens = (select from new MultiplesOf(2) as twos where twos % 5 == 0);</pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * and be sure that the optimizer will not try to do anything silly like
 * writing the contents to an intermediate array.
