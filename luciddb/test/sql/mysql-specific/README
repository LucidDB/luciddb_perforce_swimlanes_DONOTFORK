These tests are currently written to execute against a local MySQL
instance.  It must be pre-configured with a database named
MEDJDBC_TEST (which can be created via mysql.init.sql).

It would be desirable to run these tests as part of nightly builds.
That would require:

1. a server dedicated to hosting the test database
2. modification of prop.mysql to default to that server
3. introduction of luciddb/test-nightly-mysql.xml that points to this
   directory's test.xml
4. addition of test-nightly-mysql.xml to test-all.xml
5. add a target for test-mysql and call it from initBuild.sh
6. whatever work needs to be done to incorporate results into nightly build
   web pages (if any)
