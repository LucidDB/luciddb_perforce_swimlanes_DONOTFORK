Default settings:
------------------

By default, tests in this directory run against all sources and tests which 
are known failures will not be run.


Pre-requisites:
---------------

If running for the first time, mount //raksha so that
/mnt/raksha/engineering/testdata/csv_BENCH on local machine exists.

(See http://redsquare.jot.com/WikiHome/HomeDirectories
for instructions on how to do this)

Otherwise, if raksha is not available, a local copy of raksha's csv files will be used.


To run against all sources:
---------------------------
(1) in run.properties*, set:

testfile=test.xml

(2) run "ant test"


To run against one source:
--------------------------
(1) in run.properties*, set: 

testfile="benchtest.xml" (or benchcsvtest.xml if using csvjdbc)
foreign.db=[flatfile | oracle | sqlserver | csvjdbc]

(2) run "ant test"


Relevant ANT targets:
---------------------

"test" will run bh. (it will not generate the sql files, unless
they do not exist)

"gen-all-sql" will generate sql files for all sources.

"clean" will clean all testlogs, csv-copy, and generated sql files

"clean-csv" will "clean" plus delete snapshot of raksha's csv files


Note *:
--------
If prefer not to modify run.properties, can set it all from the
command line:

"ant test -Dtestfile=benchtest.xml -Dforeign.db=flatfile"
