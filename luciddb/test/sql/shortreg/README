Default settings:
------------------

By default, tests in this directory run against flatfile. Tests which are 
known failures will not be run.


To run against all sources:
---------------------------
(1) in run.properties*, set:

testfile=test-all.xml

(2) run "ant test"


To run against a specific source:
--------------------------
(1) in run.properties*, set: 

testfile="test.xml" (or sanity.xml if only running sanity tests)
foreign.db=[flatfile | oracle | sqlserver ]

(2) run "ant test"


Relevant ANT targets:
---------------------

"test" will run bh. (it will not generate or refresh the sql files, unless
they do not exist)

"gen-all-sql" will generate sql files for all sources.

"clean" will clean all testlogs, and generated sql files


Note *:
--------
If prefer not to modify run.properties, can set it all from the
command line:

"ant test -Dtestfile=sanity.xml -Dforeign.db=flatfile"
