Default settings:
------------------

By default, tests in this directory run against flatfile and tests which are
known failures will not be run.


Pre-requisites:
---------------

If running for the first time and using flatfile or csvjdbc sources, 
mount //raksha so that /mnt/raksha/engineering/testdata/csv_BENCH on 
local machine exists.

(See http://redsquare.jot.com/WikiHome/HomeDirectories
for instructions on how to do this)

Otherwise, if raksha is not available, a local copy of raksha's csv files will be used.

To run against all sources:
---------------------------
(1) in run.properties*, set:

testfile=test-all.xml

(2) run "ant test"


To run against a specific source:
--------------------------
(1) in run.properties*, set: 

foreign.db=[flatfile | oracle | sqlserver | csvjdbc]

(2) run "ant test"


Relevant ANT targets:
---------------------
"test" will run bh. (It will not generate or refresh the sql files, unless
they do not exist.  It will not create or sync the local csv files which
are required for flatfile and csvjdbc.)

"gen-all-sql" will generate sql files for all sources.

"clean" will clean all testlogs, csv-copy, and generated sql files

"clean-csv" will "clean" plus delete snapshot of raksha's csv files


Note *:
--------
If prefer not to modify run.properties, can set it all from the
command line:

"ant test -Dtestfile=test.xml -Dforeign.db=oracle"
