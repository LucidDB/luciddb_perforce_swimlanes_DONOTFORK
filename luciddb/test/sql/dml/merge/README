If running for the first time, mount //raksha so that
/mnt/raksha/engineering/testdata/csv_BENCH on local machine exists.

(See http://redsquare.jot.com/WikiHome/HomeDirectories
for instructions on how to do this)

Otherwise, if raksha is not available, a local copy of raksha's csv files will be used.
