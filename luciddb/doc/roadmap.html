<h2>LucidDB Roadmap</h2>

<hr>

<h3>First Release</h3>

We are currently wrapping up the very first open-source release (0.6).
Following the "release early, release often" open-source motto, the
focus is on showcasing the core technology even though there are many
gaps and rough edges; also, not much tuning has been done yet.  Here
are some of the major limitations you should be aware of:

<ul>

<li>subquery support is still under development

<li>security features are incomplete

<li>concurrency control supports at most one database-wide writer at a
time; writer blocks readers on the same table

<li>all transactions are autocommit

<li>unions, aggregates, and most forms of outer join work but are not
yet optimized

<li>one single database-wide auto-extend tablespace

<li>FOREIGN KEY and CHECK constraints are not supported

<li>system views and management procedures are minimal

<li>only single-byte character sets are supported; collation is always
case-sensitive

<li>no support for timezones and time intervals

<li>no ODBC driver is provided (JDBC must be used to connect to LucidDB)

<li>external user-defined routines must be written in Java

<li>UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints can be declared but are not enforced

</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Planned for Follow-on Releases</h3>

(Let us know if you're interested in contributing, either to projects
listed here or items of your own.)

<ul>

<li>UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraint enforcement

<li>complete subquery support</li>

<li>tablespaces and block-level versioning for better concurrency control
and storage management</li>

<li>robust security</li>

<li>optimizer improvements and executor performance enhancements,
including parallelism</li>

<li>more management views and functions</li>

<li>UNICODE, collations, timezones, and time intervals</li>

<li>SQL/J support</li>

<li>ALTER TABLE</li>

<li>materialized views</li>

<li>tighter Mondrian and J2EE integration</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Eventually...</h3>

<ul>
