<h2>LucidDB Roadmap</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Current Release</h3>

The current open-source release (0.7.3) of LucidDB is available for
download.  It is packed with <a href="features.html">advanced
features</a>; there are also some limitations you should be aware of:

<ul>

<li>subquery support is still under development

<li>security features are incomplete

<li>writers never block readers, but writers block other writers on
the same table

<li>all transactions are autocommit

<li>any join condition is now supported for LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN, but
FULL OUTER JOIN support is limited to equijoins

<li>one single database-wide auto-extend tablespace

<li>FOREIGN KEY and CHECK constraints are not supported

<li>a limited number of system views and management procedures are available

<li>only single-byte character sets are supported; collation is always
case-sensitive

<li>no support for timezones and time intervals

<li>no ODBC driver is provided (JDBC must be used to connect to LucidDB)

<li>external user-defined routines are written in Java

</ul>
