<h2>LucidDB Roadmap</h2>

<h3>First Release</h3>

We are currently wrapping up the very first open-source release (0.6).
Following the "release early, release often" open-source motto, the
focus is on showcasing the core technology even though there are many
gaps and rough edges; also, not much tuning has been done yet.  Here
are some of the major limitations you should be aware of:

<ul>

<li>subquery support is still under development

<li>security features are incomplete

<li>concurrency control supports only one database-wide writer at a
time, and writers block readers on the same table

<li>all transactions are autocommit

<li>unions, aggregates, and most forms of outer join work but are not
yet optimized

<li>only a single database-wide tablespace is supported

<li>FOREIGN KEY and CHECK constraints are not supported

<li>system views and management procedures are minimal

<li>only single-byte character sets are supported, along with only
a default case-sensitive collation sequence

<li>no support for timezones and time intervals

<li>no ODBC driver is provided (JDBC must be used to connect to LucidDB)

<li>user-defined routines must be written in Java

</ul>

<h3>Planned for Follow-on Releases</h3>

(Let us know if you're interested in contributing, either to projects
listed here or items of your own.)

<ul>

<li>complete subquery support</li>

<li>tablespaces and block-level versioning for better concurrency control
and storage management</li>

<li>robust security</li>

<li>optimizer improvements and executor performance enhancements,
including parallelism</li>

<li>more management views and functions</li>

<li>UNICODE, collations, timezones, and time intervals</li>

<li>SQL/J support for convenience in writing user-defined routines</li>

<li>ALTER TABLE</li>

<li>materialized views</li>

<li>tighter Mondrian and J2EE integration</li>

<li>more connectors (e.g. XLS via POI) and ETL functions</li>

</ul>

<h3>Eventually...</h3>

<ul>

<li>SQL/OLAP</li>

<li>user-level transactions</li>

<li>FOREIGN KEY and CHECK constraints</li>

<li>ODBC driver</li>

<li>fully cost-based optimization</li>

<li>user-defined types</li>

<li>bulk write to external systems</li>

<li>clustering</li>

<li>support for both row-store and column-store tables in the same database

</ul>

<h3>Maybe One Day...</h3>

<ul>

<li>SQL/XML

<li>...

</ul>
