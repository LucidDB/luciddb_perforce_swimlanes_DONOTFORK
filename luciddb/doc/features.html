Here are some of the main features which set LucidDB apart:

<p>

<table border=1>

<tr>
<td><b>Category</b></td>
<td><b>Feature</b></td>
<td><b>Benefits</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=2><i>Storage</i></td> 
<td>Column-store tables</td> 
<td>Very high data compression rates for columns with many repeated values; 
reduced I/O for queries which access only a subset of columns;
greater cache effectiveness</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Intelligent indexing</td> <td>Automatically adapts to either
bitmap or btree representation depending on data distribution (even
using both in the same index for different portions of the table),
yielding optimal data compression, reduced I/O, and fast evaluation
of boolean expressions</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=2><i>Optimization</i></td> 
<td>Star join optimization</td> 
<td>Avoids reading fact table rows which are not needed by query</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cost-based join ordering</td> 
<td>No hints required</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=3><i>Execution</i></td><td>Hash join/aggregation</td>
<td>Can scale to even the largest number-crunching datasets in limited
RAM via skew-resistant disk-based partitioning</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Selective prefetch</td> <td>High performance and greater cache and
disk effectiveness because LucidDB can almost always predict exactly
which disk blocks are needed to satisfy a query</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>INSERT/UPSERT as bulk load</td> <td>Tables can be loaded directly
from external sources via SQL; no separate bulk loader utility is
required (for performance, loads are never logged at the row-level,
yet are fully recoverable via page-level undo); the SQL:2003 MERGE
statement provides standard upsert capability</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=4><i>Connectivity</i></td> <td>SQL/MED
architecture</td> <td>Allows LucidDB to connect to heterogeneous
external data sources via <em>foreign data wrappers</em> and access
their content as <em>foreign tables</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JDBC foreign data wrapper</td> 
<td>Allows foreign tables in any JDBC data source to be queried via LucidDB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Flat file foreign data wrapper</td> 
<td>Allows flat files (e.g. BCP or CSV format) to be queried as
foreign tables via LucidDB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Pluggability</td> <td>Allows new foreign data wrappers (e.g. for
accessing data from a web service) to be developed in Java and
hot-plugged into a running LucidDB instance</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=3><i>Extensibility</i></td> <td>SQL/JRT
architecture</td> <td>Allows new functions and transformations to be 
developed in Java and hot-plugged into a running LucidDB instance;
LucidDB also comes with a companion library of common ETL functions
(<b>applib</b>)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>User-defined functions</td>
<td>Allows the set of builtin functions to be extended with custom
user logic</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>User-defined transformations</td>
<td>Allows new table functions (such as custom logic for
name and address cleansing and de-duplication)
to be added to the system</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=3><i>Standards</i></td> <td>SQL:2003
</td> <td>Smooths migration of applications to and from other DBMS 
products</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JDBC
</td> <td>Allows connectivity from popular front-ends such as
the <a target="_top" href="http://mondrian.sf.net">Mondrian</a> OLAP engine</td>
</tr>

<td>J2EE</td><td>Java architecture enables deployment of LucidDB into
a J2EE application server (just like <a target="_top"
href="http://www.hsqldb.org">hsqldb</a> or <a target="_top"
href="http://db.apache.org/derby">Derby</a>); usage of Java as
the primary extensibility mechanism makes it a snap to integrate
with the many enterprise API's available
