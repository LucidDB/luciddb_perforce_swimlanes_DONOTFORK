Here are some of the main features which set LucidDB apart:

<p>

<table border=1 style="clsStd; border-collapse:collapse">

<tr>
<td><b>Category</b></td>
<td><b>Feature</b></td>
<td><b>Benefits</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=5><i>Storage</i></td> 
<td>Column-store tables</td> 
<td>Very high data compression rates for columns with many repeated values; 
reduced I/O for queries which access only a subset of columns;
greater cache effectiveness</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Intelligent indexing</td> <td>Automatically adapts to either
bitmap or btree representation depending on data distribution (even
using both in the same index for different portions of the same
table), yielding optimal data compression, reduced I/O, and fast
evaluation of boolean expressions, without the need for a DBA to
choose index type</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Page-level multi-versioning</td> 
<td>
Supports read/write concurrency with snapshot consistency, allowing
readers to access a table while data is being bulk loaded or updated;
versioning at page-level is much more efficient than transactional
multi-versioning schemes such as row-level versioning or log-based
page reconstruction
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a target="_top"
href="http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbWarehouseLabels">Warehouse
labels</a></td>
<td>
Allows report execution to sync to a particular global database state
such as <em>last successful ETL</em> so that queries never see intermediate
inconsistent states; enables trickle-feed ETL, and may be used to
eliminate the downtime imposition of an ETL window.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a target="_top"
href="http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbBackupRestore">Hot+incremental
backup</a></td>
<td>
Allows the system to be backed up consistently while queries and ETL
are running, eliminating downtime; incremental and compression options
minimize archival storage and bandwidth.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=2><i>Optimization</i></td> 
<td>Star join optimization</td> 
<td>Avoids reading fact table rows which are not needed by query</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cost-based join ordering and index selection</td> 
<td>No hints required</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=3><i>Execution</i></td><td>Hash join/aggregation</td>
<td>Can scale to number-crunch even the largest datasets in limited
RAM via skew-resistant disk-based partitioning</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Intelligent prefetch</td> <td>High
performance and greater cache and disk effectiveness because LucidDB
can almost always predict exactly which disk blocks are needed to
satisfy a query</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>INSERT/UPSERT as bulk load</td> <td>Tables can be loaded directly
from external sources via SQL; no separate bulk loader utility is
required (for performance, loads are never logged at the row-level,
yet are fully recoverable via page-level undo); the SQL:2003 MERGE
statement provides standard upsert capability</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=5><i>Connectivity</i></td> <td>SQL/MED
architecture</td> <td>Allows LucidDB to connect to heterogeneous
external data sources via <em>foreign data wrappers</em> and access
their content as <em>foreign tables</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JDBC foreign data wrapper</td> 
<td>Allows foreign tables in any JDBC data source to be queried via LucidDB,
with filters pushed down to the source where possible</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Flat file foreign data wrapper</td> 
<td>Allows flat files (e.g. BCP or CSV format) to be queried as
foreign tables via LucidDB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Pluggability</td> <td>Allows new foreign data wrappers (e.g. for
accessing data from a web service) to be developed in Java and
hot-plugged into a running LucidDB instance</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><a target="_top"
href="http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbPdiBulkLoad">Pentaho Data
Integration plugin</a></td> Allows data to be pushed into LucidDB from
the Kettle ETL tool<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=3><i>Extensibility</i></td> <td>SQL/JRT
architecture</td> <td>Allows new functions and transformations to be 
developed in Java and hot-plugged into a running LucidDB instance;
LucidDB also comes with a companion library of common ETL functions
(<b>applib</b>)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>User-defined functions</td>
<td>Allows the set of builtin functions to be extended with custom
user logic</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>User-defined transformations</td>
<td>Allows new table functions (such as custom logic for
data mining operators or CONNECT BY queries)
to be added to the system</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=4><i>Standards</i></td> <td>SQL:2003
</td> <td>Smooths migration of applications to and from other DBMS 
products</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JDBC
</td> <td>Allows connectivity from popular front-ends such as
the <a target="_top" href="http://mondrian.sf.net">Mondrian</a> OLAP engine</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>UNICODE
</td> <td>Supports storage and access to international character data</td>
</tr>

<td>J2EE</td><td>Java architecture enables deployment of LucidDB into
a J2EE application server (just like <a target="_top"
href="http://www.hsqldb.org">hsqldb</a> or <a target="_top"
href="http://db.apache.org/derby">Derby</a>); usage of Java as
the primary extensibility mechanism makes it a snap to integrate
with the many enterprise API's available
