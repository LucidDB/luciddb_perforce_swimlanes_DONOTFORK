LucidDB is an open-source RDBMS purpose-built for data warehousing and
business intelligence.  Most database systems (both proprietary and
open-source) focus on transaction processing capabilities, and only
bolt on analytical capabilities as an afterthought.  By contrast,
every component of LucidDB was designed with the requirements of
flexible, high-performance data integration and sophisticated query
processing in mind.  Moreover, comprehensiveness within the focused
scope of its architecture means simplicity for the user: no DBA
required.

Wondering why you might want to spend time trying out LucidDB when the
open-source DBMS field is already crowded with so many good horses?
Use the navigation bar on the left to browse features, architecture,
roadmap, etc to find out.
