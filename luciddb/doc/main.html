LucidDB is the first and only open-source RDBMS purpose-built entirely
for data warehousing and business intelligence.  It is based on
architectural cornerstones such as column-store, bitmap indexing, hash
join/aggregation, and page-level multiversioning.  Most database
systems (both proprietary and open-source) start life with a focus on
transaction processing capabilities, then get analytical capabilities
bolted on as an afterthought (if at all).  By contrast, every
component of LucidDB was designed with the requirements of flexible,
high-performance data integration and sophisticated query processing
in mind.  Moreover, comprehensiveness within the focused scope of its
architecture means simplicity for the user: no DBA required.

<p>

Rather than throwing hardware at data warehousing problems by relying
on expensive clusters or specialized "appliances", the scalability
offered by LucidDB's unique architecture allows you to achieve great
performance using only a single off-the-shelf Linux or Windows server.
Besides keeping costs down, this also minimizes maintenance and
administration hassles.

Still wondering why you might want to spend time trying out LucidDB
when the open-source DBMS field is already crowded with so many good
horses?  Use the navigation bar on the left to browse features,
