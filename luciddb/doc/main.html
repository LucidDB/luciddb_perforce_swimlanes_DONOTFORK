LucidDB is the first and only open-source RDBMS purpose-built entirely
for data warehousing and business intelligence.  Most database systems
(both proprietary and open-source) start life with a focus on
transaction processing capabilities, then get analytical capabilities
bolted on as an afterthought (if at all).  By contrast, every
component of LucidDB was designed with the requirements of flexible,
high-performance data integration and sophisticated query processing
in mind.  Moreover, comprehensiveness within the focused scope of its
architecture means simplicity for the user: no DBA required.

Wondering why you might want to spend time trying out LucidDB when the
open-source DBMS field is already crowded with so many good horses?
