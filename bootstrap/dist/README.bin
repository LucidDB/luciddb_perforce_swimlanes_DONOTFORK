RUNNING

From the bin directory, run farragoServer to start the server.  
A JDBC client program is provided:

- run sqllineClient from a new shell for command-line access; enter
!help for a list of commands (!tables gives a list of available tables
to query)

A standalone Farrago JDBC client jar is not yet available, so to
connect to the server from another JDBC client program, the program
will need to load lib/farrago.jar and lib/vjdbc.jar.  For JDBC
driver class name, use
net.sf.farrago.jdbc.client.FarragoVjdbcClientDriver.  For JDBC URL, use
jdbc:farrago:rmi://localhost (or actual server name for a remote
connection).

RELEASE NOTES

This binary release is intended for use by anyone who wants to test
out the Eigenbase platform or one of its sub-projects without having
to build anything.  We encourage users to explore the platform and
test out possibilities for integration with other projects.
