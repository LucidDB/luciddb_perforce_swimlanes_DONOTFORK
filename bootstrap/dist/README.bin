HOME PAGE

For information about the project, please see

----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

From the install directory, run install.sh on Linux or install.bat on Windows.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING

From the bin directory, run farragoServer to start the server.  
A JDBC client program is provided:

- run sqllineClient from a new shell for command-line access; enter
!help for a list of commands (!tables gives a list of available tables
to query)

A standalone Farrago JDBC client jar is not yet available, so to
connect to the server from another JDBC client program, the program
will need to load lib/farrago.jar and (TODO:  VJDBC).  For JDBC
driver class name, use
net.sf.farrago.jdbc.client.FarragoVjdbcClientDriver.  For JDBC URL, use
jdbc:farrago:rmi://localhost (or actual server name for a remote
connection).

------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE NOTES

This binary release is intended for use by anyone who wants to test
out the Eigenbase platform without having to build anything.  We
encourage users to explore the platform and test out possibilities for
integration with other projects.
