Building Cruise Control
-----------------------

Extract cruisecontrol-2.1.5.tar.gz, change to its main subdirectory and
run build.sh or build.bat.  Cruisecontrol should build and run its
unit tests.

Installing Cruise Control
-------------------------

I do not recommend running Cruise Control as root.  I've created a
user on my system to execute Cruise Control and until now I've been
manually starting it up with startcc-chumley.sh (see below).

Assuming CC_HOME points to the main cruisecontrol directory, add
$CC_HOME/main/bin to your path.

Create a subdirectory in your mapped //open/bootstrap call ant and
install the version of Ant provided in //open/thirdparty there.  The
script doant.sh will be used by Cruisecontrol to execute Ant (the
version of Ant shipped with Cruisecontrol is too old for our
purposes).

The ant build scripts expect that a Perforce client has been created
with then name "$USER.$HOSTNAME" on both Perforce servers and that the
following paths are mapped.  Assume [work] refers to Cruisecontrol's
working directory.

Eigenbase:
	//open/farrago/...	[work]/farrago
	//open/fennel/...	[work]/fennel
	//open/saffron/...	[work]/saffron
	//open/thirdparty/...	[work]/thirdparty

Disruptive:
	//depot/aspen/...	[work]/aspen

The shell script startcc-chumley.sh starts Cruise Control and enables
a JMX service on port 8080.  This port should be firewalled from
access by outside users -- the JMX service has no protection against
malicious users.  You'll need a corresponding startcc-yourmachine.sh
(which we'll refer to as startcc.sh) and config-yourmachine.xml (which
we'll refer to as config.xml).

The ant build scripts assume the presence of a file called
disruptive.perforce.properties which configures Ant's p4 tasks to connect to
the Disruptive Perforce server.

Before executing startcc.sh, set the environment variable
CRUISE_P4PASSWD to the Disruptive Perforce server's guest password.
If you're allowed to have it, you'll know what I mean when I say, "ask
Julian."

startcc.sh will create some directories that Cruise Control will use,
if they don't exist.

config.xml attempts to move build results to another
server.  You'll need to configure ssh for automatic login to that
server in for the copy to actually succeed.  This means creating an
RSA public/private keypair and placing them in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and
~/.ssh/id_rsa_pub and modifiying ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server
to contain a copy of the public key.  "man ssh" for more info.  Note
that having two build servers copy data to the same place
isn't a good idea!  However, you can use configSuffix to parameterize
the project names, so that builds from different platforms go to
different locations on the same server.



Notes from JVS 8-Aug-2004
-------------------------

To build cruisecontrol.war, I had to create a file
$CC_HOME/reporting/jsp/override.properties with the following settings
(you may need to use somethng different depending on your Tomcat setup):
user.log.dir=/home/cruise/web/logs
user.build.status.file=currentbuildstatus.txt
cruise.build.artifacts.dir=/home/cruise/web/artifacts

I also had to create the saffron, fennel, and farrago directories
manually under /home/cruise/web/logs, otherwise scp failed when it
tried to copy into non-existent locations.

To eliminate some errors from Tomcat while trying to view the build
result pages, I had to copy xalan.jar from $CC_HOME/reporting/jsp/lib
to $TOMCAT_HOME/common/endorsed.  I figured this out by reading
http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/EndorsedLibsProblem.

Win32 Notes from JVS 20-Sept-2004
---------------------------------
To build cruisecontrol, I had to set JAVA_HOME to a DOS path and run
build.bat instead of build.sh.
