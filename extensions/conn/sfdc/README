SFDC Connector
--------------

Original Contributor to Eigenbase is LucidEra, Inc.

Build Notes:
 - Due to licensing restrictions on the Salesforce.com WSDL we have omitted
   the WSDL from Eigenbase source code control.
 - Create a "build.properties" (there is a template) and fill in your information
 - For building, you have to set the property wsdl= the URL of your partner 
 - Make sure you have existing farragoenv.sh and fennelenv.sh sourced
 - ant clean compile

Two Targets:
 - MedSfdc.jar - contains ONLY the SQL/MED for Salesforce
 - MedSfdcComplete.jar - contains everything in MedSfdc.jar and all dependencies
   (such as commons-codec, axis, etc).  A convenience for CREATE JAR use.
