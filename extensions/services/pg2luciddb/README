PG2LucidDB: PostgreSQL frontend for LucidDB column-oriented database
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Contributor to Eigenbase is Alexander Mekhrishvili

What is it?

  * This is cross-platform tool which acts as a bridge between PostgreSQL's frontend protocol
    and LucidDB database engine (http://www.luciddb.org/). In another words - this is the only
    tool which allows to access LucidDB from almost any programming language which has native
    driver for widely known PostgreSQL database


Why should I use it? 

  * LucidDB is an outstanding column-based database engine. One of it's most significant drawback
    in comparison with another competitors is the fact that it can be accessed only from Java-based 
    application using it's own JDBC driver. The main goal of PG2LucidDB is to fill this gap & make 
    it's possible to use the power of LucidDB from any third-party applications & programming languages


Why PostgreSQL's protocol?
 
  * The're 3 main reasons behind that decision:

    1. PostgreSQL is very mature & well-known database engine. It's already has drivers for almost
       all programming languages which gives an ability to implement only server-side part and use
       already existing client-side tools 

    2. It was relatively simple to implement it

    3. There were already several existing products which acts in the same way: H2 database
       (http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) and Continuent Tungsten Connector 
       (http://www.continuent.com/community/tungsten-connector). Actually PG2LucidDB partially
       uses the sources from H2 database repository.


Is it free?
 
  * Completely. This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published by the 
    Free Software Foundation. 


Is is stable & production ready?

  * Due to very significant differences between PostgreSQL & LucidDB it will be almost impossible to make all the 
    things working "out of the box" (i.e. - schema retrieval queries for ODBC provider). A lot of testing under
    real conditions and heavy load is required to proof PG2LucidDB's stability and probably there are still
    a lot of bugs in the code, so - use it at your own risk. The good news are that current bridge's version works 
    pretty fine and already gives ability to query LucidDB from almost any programming language (it has been tested
    with PHP, Perl, C# using .NET provider and JScript using ODBC provider)



---- OLD STUFF 


How to install?

  * Just follow these sample steps:

    1. Extract all the files from ZIP into directory on your server (it could be either dedicated box or 
       the same as you use for your LucidDB instance)
    2. Copy pg_catalog_plugin.jar from build directory to your LucidDB's plugin directory
    3. Modify config files in conf directory. Pay attention to:

       - JDBC connection string to your LucidDB in PG2LucidDB.properties file
       - Database admin's username & password in PG2LucidDB.properties file
       - Specify your db's users in allowed.users file (don't forget to create users in LucidDB first)
       - Specify the hosts which will be allowed to connect to PG2LucidDB in authorized.hosts file or 
         disable this check in PG2LucidDB.properties file

    5. On WINDOWS: check that you have JAVA_HOME variable with valid path to installed Java runtime
    4. Run PG2LucidDB:

       - On *nix: ./pg2luciddb
       - On WINDOWS: pg2luciddb.bat

       First time it will take pretty long time to start, because PG2LucidDB will initialize it's own 
       database schema (PG_CATALOG)

    5. On WINDOWS: If you want to install PG2LucidDB as a service please check win32 project's folder
       for more details and ready to run batch files. You will need Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 to run ServiceWrapper 
       application


How to use it?

  * Just see sample scripts in the samples directory. 


How to build from the scratch?

  * On WINDOWS:

     1. Check that you have JDK version 1.5 or 1.6 installed a
     2. Set JDK_HOME environment variable 
     2. Run build_jdk5.bat or build_jdk6.bat
