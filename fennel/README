BUILD

release for your platform.

RELEASE NOTES

This source release is intended for use by developers who want to
build, test, use, and possibly modify Fennel without having to access
the Eigenbase source control system.  Fennel has been under
development for quite some time and (depending on application
requirements) may be suitable for production use.

However, developers should be aware that all interfaces (API's, SPI's,
and class libraries) are still in a fluid state and subject to
frequent review and change.  As interfaces solidify, they will be
officially frozen in future releases.
