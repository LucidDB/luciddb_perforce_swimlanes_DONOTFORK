OVERVIEW

The Fennel project is a library of data storage and processing
components in C++; it is intended for embedding in higher-level data
management projects, in particular the companion Farrago project
(http://farrago.sourceforge.net).

Contact perfecthash@users.sf.net if you're interested in contributing,
