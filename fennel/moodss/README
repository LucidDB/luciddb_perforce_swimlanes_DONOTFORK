To integrate Fennel statistics into the moodss performance monitor
(http://moodss.sf.net), install moodss and then soft-link
this directory as a sub-directory of /usr/lib/moodss named fennel.
When you start moodss, fennel should show up as a loadable module.
For now, fennel always writes its stats to /tmp/fennel.stats, which
is where the module expects them by default.  You can load example.moo
into moodss with

moodss -f example.moo
