<h1>Got Data?</h1>

<p>
Firewater is an open source scaleout RDBMS based on column store
technology. It allows a cluster of commodity servers or virtualized
cloud nodes to be used for fast response times on SQL and OLAP queries
over massive datasets.  It can also be used to parallelize execution
even on a single multi-core node.
</p>

<p>
The project is being developed under <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL v2</a> as an
extension to <a href="http://www.eigenbase.org">the Eigenbase
platform</a>, reusing much of the technology from <a
href="http://www.luciddb.org">LucidDB</a>.  However, Firewater and
LucidDB are developed as two separate projects; features in Firewater
may not be available in LucidDB, and vice versa.
</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>

We're currently incubating the project; it's not yet ready for anyone
but developers.  However, some <a
href="http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/FirewaterDocs">documentation</a>
is available; in particular, you might want to read about the <a
href="http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/FirewaterDistributedArchitecture">
architecture</a> and join the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=263817">mailing list</a>.
