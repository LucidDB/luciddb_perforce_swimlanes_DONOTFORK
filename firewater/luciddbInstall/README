Firewater->LucidDB patch installation notes

The following scripts modify an existing installation of LucidDB
into a Firewater server that can be connected to and accessed
via LucidDB's standard JDBC driver.

NOTE: This is likely FULLY destructive to the target LucidDB 
installation.  You should do this ONLY on a fresh LucidDB 
installation that does not have any data at all!
NOTE: Instructions are for Linux only; should you really be using
Firewater on Windoze?  ;)

1) Install a fresh, LucidDB installation that has been compiled
   with --with-repos-type=hsqldb/netbeans ($LDB)
2) Copy firewater.jar and firewater-jdbc.jar to directory
   $LDB/plugin/
3) Copy files
   fwServer fwEngine 
   to 
   $LDB/bin
4) run $LDB/install/install.sh
5) edit classpath.gen 
   add entries for the following files
   $LDB/plugin/firewater.jar
   $LDB/plugin/firewater-jdbc.jar
   $LDB/plugin/FarragoMedJdbc.jar
6) Run installMetamodel.sql script using sqllineEngine
   cat installMetamodel.sql | bin/sqllineEngine
7) Run installSystemObjects.sql script using fwEngine
   cat installSystemObjects.sql | bin/fwEngine
8) Start your new Firewater server using 
   bin/fwServer

You can connect to fwServer via a regular LucidDB client (sqllineClient)
or remote JDBC url (org.luciddb.jdbc.LucidDbClientDriver) 

NOTE: You HAVE to create a FIREWATER_REPLICA catalog on each LucidDB 
server in order for it to be used in a Firewater cluster.
